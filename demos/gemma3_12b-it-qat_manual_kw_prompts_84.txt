Context: ['Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space—sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "star-forming regions"—collapse and form stars. As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products.  It is closely related to planet formation, another branch of astronomy.  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function. Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a group of stars referred  as star clusters or stellar associations.\n== First stars ==\nStar formation is divided into three groups called "Populations". Population III stars formed from primordial hydrogen after the Big Bang. These stars are poorly understood but should contain only hydrogen and helium. Population II stars formed from the debris of the first stars and they in turn created more higher atomic number chemical elements. Population I stars are young metal-rich (contain elements other than hydrogen and helium) stars like our Sun.\nThe initial star formation was driven by gravitational attraction of hydrogen local areas of higher gravity called dark matter halos. As the hydrogen lost energy through atomic or molecular energy transitions, the temperature of local clumps fell allowing more gravitational condensation. Eventually the process leads to collapse in to a start. Details of the dynamics of the Population III stars is now believe to be as complex as star formation today.\n== Stellar nurseries ==\n=== Interstellar clouds ===\nSpiral galaxies like the Milky Way contain stars, stellar remnants, and a diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 104 to 106 particles per cm3, and is typically composed of roughly 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements by mass. The trace amounts of heavier elements were and are produced within stars via stellar nucleosynthesis and ejected as the stars pass beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or diffuse nebulae, where star formation takes place. In contrast to spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies lose the cold component of its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through  mergers with other galaxies.\nIn the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H2) form, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds. The Herschel Space Observatory has revealed that filaments, or elongated dense gas structures, are truly ubiquitous in molecular clouds and central to the star formation process. They fragment into gravitationally bound cores, most of which will evolve into stars. Continuous accretion of gas, geometrical bending, and magnetic fields may control the detailed manner in which the filaments are fragmented. Observations of supercritical filaments have revealed quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with spacing comparable to the filament inner width, and embedded protostars with outflows.\nObservations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, which are first observed via the infrared light they emit inside the clouds, and then as visible light when the clouds dissipate. Giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses. These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm3, diameters of 100 light-years (9.5×1014 km), masses of up to 6 million solar masses (M☉), or six million times the mass of Earth\'s sun. The average interior temperature is 10 K (−441.7 °F).\nAbout half the total mass of the Milky Way\'s galactic ISM is found in molecular clouds and the galaxy includes an estimated 6,000 molecular clouds, each with more than 100,000 M☉. The nebula nearest to the Sun where massive stars are being formed is the Orion Nebula, 1,300 light-years (1.2×1016 km) away. However, lower mass star formation is occurring about 400–450 light-years distant in the ρ Ophiuchi cloud complex.\nA more compact site of star formation is the opaque clouds of dense gas and dust known as Bok globules, so named after the astronomer Bart Bok. These can form in association with collapsing molecular clouds or possibly independently. The Bok globules are typically up to a light-year across and contain a few solar masses. They can be observed as dark clouds silhouetted against bright emission nebulae or background stars. Over half the known Bok globules have been found to contain newly forming stars.\n=== Cloud collapse ===\nAn interstellar cloud of gas will remain in hydrostatic equilibrium as long as the kinetic energy of the gas pressure is in balance with the potential energy of the internal gravitational force. Mathematically this is expressed using the virial theorem, which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy. If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo gravitational collapse. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the Jeans mass. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses. During cloud collapse dozens to tens of thousands of stars form more or less simultaneously which is observable in so-called embedded clusters. The end product of a core collapse is an  open cluster of stars.\nIn triggered star formation, one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby supernova explosion can be a trigger, sending shocked matter into the cloud at very high speeds. (The resulting new stars may themselves soon produce supernovae, producing self-propagating star formation.)  Alternatively, galactic collisions can trigger massive starbursts of star formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by tidal forces. The latter mechanism may be responsible for the formation of globular clusters.\nA supermassive black hole at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become active, emitting a strong wind through a collimated relativistic jet. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies. However, the radio emissions around the jets may also trigger star formation. Likewise, a weaker jet may trigger star formation when it collides with a cloud.\nAs it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of gravitational potential energy.  As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.\nComplicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of turbulence, macroscopic flows, rotation, magnetic fields and the cloud geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a cloud. Turbulence is instrumental in causing fragmentation of the cloud, and on the smallest scales it promotes collapse.\n== Protostar ==\nA protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of 60–100 K, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.\nDuring the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about 10−13 g / cm3. A core region, called the first hydrostatic core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.\nWhen the core temperature reaches about 2000 K, the thermal energy dissociates the H2 molecules. This is followed by the ionization of the hydrogen and helium atoms. These processes absorb the energy of the contraction, allowing it to continue on timescales comparable to the period of collapse at free fall velocities. After the density of infalling material has reached about 10−8 g / cm3, that material is sufficiently transparent to allow energy radiated by the protostar to escape. The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further. This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal pressure to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called hydrostatic equilibrium. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a protostar.', 'Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space—sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "star-forming regions"—collapse and form stars.

Context: ['Coffee ring effect\n\nIn physics, a "coffee ring" is a pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. The phenomenon is named for the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. It is also commonly seen after spilling red wine.

The flow, if strong, redistributes particles back to the center of the droplet.  Thus, for particles to accumulate at the edges, the liquid must have a weak Marangoni flow, or something must occur to disrupt the flow.

This result means that surfactants can be used to manipulate the motion of the solute particles by changing the surface tension of the drop, rather than trying to control the bulk flow inside the drop.

On a heated hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit forms, which is attributed to Marangoni convection.\nControl of the substrate wetting properties on slippery surfaces can prevent the pinning of the drop contact line, which will, therefore, suppress the coffee ring effect by reducing the number of particles deposited at the contact line. Drops on superhydrophobic or liquid impregnated surfaces are less likely to have a pinned contact line and will suppress ring formation. Drops with an oil ring formed at the drop contact line have high mobility and can avoid the ring formation on hydrophobic surfaces.\nAlternating voltage electrowetting may suppress coffee stains without the need to add surface-active materials. Reverse particle motion may also reduce the coffee-ring effect because of the capillary force near the contact line.

When the liquid evaporates much faster than the particle movement near a three-phase contact line, a coffee ring cannot be formed successfully.  Instead, these particles will disperse uniformly on a surface upon complete liquid evaporation.  For suspended particles of size 100 nm, the minimum diameter of the coffee ring structure is found to be 10 μm, or about 10 times smaller than the width of human hair.

Orientation is afforded by the system trying to reach a state of maximum packing of the particles in the thin meniscus layer over which evaporation occurs. They showed that tuning the volume fraction of particles in solution will control the specific location along the varying meniscus thickness at which assembly occurs. Particles will align with their long axis in- or out-of-plane depending on whether or not their longer dimension of the particle was equal to the thickness of the wetting layer at the meniscus location. Such thickness transitions were established with spherical particles as well.

Given the following question, context, and choices, carefully analyze each choice to determine which one is correct. Break down the problem step by step:

Context: ['=== Instant valve closure; compressible fluid ===\nThe pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the Joukowsky equation\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial P}{\\partial t}}=\\rho a{\\frac {\\partial v}{\\partial t}}.}\nSo for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximal magnitude of the water hammer pulse is\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta P=\\rho a_{0}\\Delta v,}\nwhere ΔP is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), ρ is the density of the fluid (kg/m3), a0 is the speed of sound in the fluid (m/s), and Δv is the change in the fluid\'s velocity (m/s). The pulse comes about due to Newton\'s laws of motion and the continuity equation applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.\n==== Equation for wave speed ====\nAs the speed of sound in a fluid is\n{\\displaystyle a={\\sqrt {\\frac {B}{\\rho }}}}\n, the peak pressure depends on the fluid compressibility if the valve is closed abruptly.\n{\\displaystyle B={\\frac {K}{(1+{\\frac {V}{a}})(1+c{\\frac {KD}{Et}})}},}\nwhere\na = wave speed,\nB = equivalent bulk modulus of elasticity of the system fluid–pipe,\nρ = density of the fluid,\nK = bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid,\nE = elastic modulus of the pipe,\nD = internal pipe diameter,\nt = pipe wall thickness,\nc = dimensionless parameter due to system pipe-constraint condition on wave speed.\n=== Slow valve closure; incompressible fluid ===\nWhen the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of inertance or rigid column theory:\n{\\displaystyle F=ma=PA=\\rho LA{dv \\over dt}.}\nAssuming constant deceleration of the water column (dv/dt = v/t), this gives\n{\\displaystyle P=\\rho Lv/t.}\nwhere:\nF = force [N],\nm = mass of the fluid column [kg],\na = acceleration [m/s2],\nP = pressure [Pa],\nA = pipe cross-section [m2],\nρ = fluid density [kg/m3],\nL = pipe length [m],\nv = flow velocity [m/s],\nt = valve closure time [s].\nThe above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit,\n0.0135\n{\\displaystyle P=0.0135\\,VL/t.}\nFor practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:\n0.07\n{\\displaystyle P=0.07\\,VL/t+P_{1},}\nwhere P1 is the inlet pressure in psi, V is the flow velocity in ft/s, t is the valve closing time in seconds, and L is the upstream pipe length in feet.\nHence, we can say that the magnitude of the water hammer largely depends upon the time of closure, elastic components of pipe & fluid properties.\n== Expression for the excess pressure due to water hammer ==\nWhen a valve with a volumetric flow rate Q is closed, an excess pressure ΔP is created upstream of the valve, whose value is given by the Joukowsky equation:\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta P=ZQ.}\nIn this expression:\nΔP is the overpressurization in Pa;\nQ is the volumetric flow in m3/s;\nZ is the hydraulic impedance, expressed in kg/m4/s.\nThe hydraulic impedance Z of the pipeline determines the magnitude of the water hammer pulse. It is itself defined by\n{\\displaystyle Z={\\frac {\\sqrt {\\rho B}}{A}},}\nwhere\nρ the density of the liquid, expressed in kg/m3;\nA cross sectional area of the pipe, m2;\nB equivalent modulus of compressibility of the liquid in the pipe, expressed in Pa.\nThe latter follows from a series of hydraulic concepts:\ncompressibility of the liquid, defined by its adiabatic compressibility modulus Bl, resulting from the equation of state of the liquid generally available from thermodynamic tables;\nthe elasticity of the walls of the pipe, which defines an equivalent bulk modulus of compressibility for the solid Bs. In the case of a pipe of circular cross-section whose thickness t is small compared to the diameter D, the equivalent modulus of compressibility is given by the formula\n{\\displaystyle B={\\frac {t}{D}}E}\n, in which E is the Young\'s modulus (in Pa) of the material of the pipe;\npossibly compressibility Bg of gas dissolved in the liquid, defined by\n{\\displaystyle B_{\\text{g}}={\\frac {\\gamma }{\\alpha }}P,}\nγ being the specific heat ratio of the gas,\nα the rate of ventilation (the volume fraction of undissolved gas),\nand P the pressure (in Pa).\nThus, the equivalent elasticity is the sum of the original elasticities:\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{B}}={\\frac {1}{B_{\\text{l}}}}+{\\frac {1}{B_{\\text{s}}}}+{\\frac {1}{B_{\\text{g}}}}.}\nAs a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by:\nincreasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column;\nemploying the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus);\nintroducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator;\nwhere possible, increasing the fraction of undissolved gases in the liquid.\n== Dynamic equations ==\nThe water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations.\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial x}}+{\\frac {1}{B}}{\\frac {dP}{dt}}=0,}\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dV}{dt}}+{\\frac {1}{\\rho }}{\\frac {\\partial P}{\\partial x}}+{\\frac {f}{2D}}V|V|=0,}\nwhere V is the fluid velocity inside pipe,\n{\\displaystyle \\rho }\nis the fluid density, B is the equivalent bulk modulus, and f is the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor.\n== Column separation ==\nColumn separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water-hammer event.  If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid, cavitation will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure).  This is most likely to occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope).  When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases.  This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space.  The liquid on either side of the vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference.  The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure.  This pressure rise can damage hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures.  Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.\n== Simulation software ==\nMost water hammer software packages use the method of characteristics to solve the differential equations involved. This method works well if the wave speed does not vary in time due to either air or gas entrainment in a pipeline. The wave method (WM) is also used in various software packages. WM lets operators analyze large networks efficiently. Many commercial and non-commercial packages are available.\nSoftware packages vary in complexity, dependent on the processes modeled. The more sophisticated packages may have any of the following features:\nMultiphase flow capabilities.\nAn algorithm for cavitation growth and collapse.\nUnsteady friction: the pressure waves dampen as turbulence is generated and due to variations in the flow velocity distribution.\nVarying bulk modulus for higher pressures (water becomes less compressible).\nFluid structure interaction: the pipeline reacts on the varying pressures and causes pressure waves itself.\n== Applications ==\nThe water hammer principle can be used to create a simple water pump called a hydraulic ram.\nLeaks can sometimes be detected using water hammer.\nEnclosed air pockets can be detected in pipelines.\nThe water hammer from a liquid jet created by a collapsing microcavity is studied for potential applications noninvasive transdermal drug delivery.\n== See also ==\nBlood hammer\nCavitation\nFluid dynamics\nHydraulophone – musical instruments employing water and other fluids\nImpact force\nRecoil (fluid behavior)\nTransient (civil engineering)\nWatson\'s water hammer pulse\n== References ==\n== External links ==\nWhat Is Water Hammer/Steam Hammer?\n"Water hammer"—YouTube (animation)\n"Water Hammer Theory Explained"—YouTube; with examples', '=== Instant valve closure; compressible fluid ===\nThe pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the Joukowsky equation\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial P}{\\partial t}}=\\rho a{\\frac {\\partial v}{\\partial t}}.}\nSo for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximal magnitude of the water hammer pulse is\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta P=\\rho a_{0}\\Delta v,}\nwhere ΔP is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), ρ is the density of the fluid (kg/m3), a0 is the speed of sound in the fluid (m/s), and Δv is the change in the fluid\'s velocity (m/s).

The pulse comes about due to Newton\'s laws of motion and the continuity equation applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.\n==== Equation for wave speed ====\nAs the speed of sound in a fluid is\n{\\displaystyle a={\\sqrt {\\frac {B}{\\rho }}}}\n, the peak pressure depends on the fluid compressibility if the valve is closed abruptly.\n{\\displaystyle B={\\frac {K}{(1+{\\frac {V}{a}})(1+c{\\frac {KD}{Et}})}},}\nwhere\na = wave speed,\nB = equivalent bulk modulus of elasticity of the system fluid–pipe,\nρ = density of the fluid,\nK = bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid,\nE = elastic modulus of the pipe,\nD = internal pipe diameter,\nt = pipe wall thickness,\nc = dimensionless parameter due to system pipe-constraint condition on wave speed.\n=== Slow valve closure; incompressible fluid ===\nWhen the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of inertance or rigid column theory:\n{\\displaystyle F=ma=PA=\\rho LA{dv \\over dt}.}\nAssuming constant deceleration of the water column (dv/dt = v/t), this gives\n{\\displaystyle P=\\rho Lv/t.}\nwhere:\nF = force [N],\nm = mass of the fluid column [kg],\na = acceleration [m/s2],\nP = pressure [Pa],\nA = pipe cross-section [m2],\nρ = fluid density [kg/m3],\nL = pipe length [m],\nv = flow velocity [m/s],\nt = valve closure time [s].\nThe above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit,\n0.0135\n{\\displaystyle P=0.0135\\,VL/t.}\nFor practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:\n0.07\n{\\displaystyle P=0.07\\,VL/t+P_{1},}\nwhere P1 is the inlet pressure in psi, V is the flow velocity in ft/s, t is the valve closing time in seconds, and L is the upstream pipe length in feet.\nHence, we can say that the magnitude of the water hammer largely depends upon the time of closure, elastic components of pipe & fluid properties.\n== Expression for the excess pressure due to water hammer ==\nWhen a valve with a volumetric flow rate Q is closed, an excess pressure ΔP is created upstream of the valve, whose value is given by the Joukowsky equation:\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta P=ZQ.}\nIn this expression:\nΔP is the overpressurization in Pa;\nQ is the volumetric flow in m3/s;\nZ is the hydraulic impedance, expressed in kg/m4/s.\nThe hydraulic impedance Z of the pipeline determines the magnitude of the water hammer pulse. It is itself defined by\n{\\displaystyle Z={\\frac {\\sqrt {\\rho B}}{A}},}\nwhere\nρ the density of the liquid, expressed in kg/m3;\nA cross sectional area of the pipe, m2;\nB equivalent modulus of compressibility of the liquid in the pipe, expressed in Pa.\nThe latter follows from a series of hydraulic concepts:\ncompressibility of the liquid, defined by its adiabatic compressibility modulus Bl, resulting from the equation of state of the liquid generally available from thermodynamic tables;\nthe elasticity of the walls of the pipe, which defines an equivalent bulk modulus of compressibility for the solid Bs. In the case of a pipe of circular cross-section whose thickness t is small compared to the diameter D, the equivalent modulus of compressibility is given by the formula\n{\\displaystyle B={\\frac {t}{D}}E}\n, in which E is the Young\'s modulus (in Pa) of the material of the pipe;\npossibly compressibility Bg of gas dissolved in the liquid, defined by\n{\\displaystyle B_{\\text{g}}={\\frac {\\gamma }{\\alpha }}P,}\nγ being the specific heat ratio of the gas,\nα the rate of ventilation (the volume fraction of undissolved gas),\nand P the pressure (in Pa).\nThus, the equivalent elasticity is the sum of the original elasticities:\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{B}}={\\frac {1}{B_{\\text{l}}}}+{\\frac {1}{B_{\\text{s}}}}+{\\frac {1}{B_{\\text{g}}}}.}\nAs a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by:\nincreasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column;\nemploying the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus);\nintroducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator;\nwhere possible, increasing the fraction of undissolved gases in the liquid.\n== Dynamic equations ==\nThe water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations.\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial x}}+{\\frac {1}{B}}{\\frac {dP}{dt}}=0,}\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dV}{dt}}+{\\frac {1}{\\rho }}{\\frac {\\partial P}{\\partial x}}+{\\frac {f}{2D}}V|V|=0,}\nwhere V is the fluid velocity inside pipe,\n{\\displaystyle \\rho }\nis the fluid density, B is the equivalent bulk modulus, and f is the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor.\n== Column separation ==\nColumn separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water-hammer event.  If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid, cavitation will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure).  This is most likely to occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope).  When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases.  This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space.  The liquid on either side of the vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference.  The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure.  This pressure rise can damage hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures.  Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.\n== Simulation software ==\nMost water hammer software packages use the method of characteristics to solve the differential equations involved.

Question: What can be inferred about the electronic entropy of insulators and metals based on their densities of states at the Fermi level?

Choices:
Choice A) Insulators and metals have zero density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore, their density of states-based electronic entropy is essentially zero.

Context: ['In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the very early universe. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. The re-acceleration of this slowing expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago).\nInflation theory was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with notable contributions by several theoretical physicists, including Alexei Starobinsky at Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Alan Guth at Cornell University, and Andrei Linde at Lebedev Physical Institute. Starobinsky, Guth, and Linde won the 2014 Kavli Prize "for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation". It was developed further in the early 1980s. It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.\nThe detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown. A number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation; for example temperature anisotropies observed by the COBE satellite in 1992 exhibit nearly scale-invariant spectra as predicted by the inflationary paradigm and WMAP results also show strong evidence for inflation. However, some scientists dissent from this position. The hypothetical field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton.\nIn 2002, three of the original architects of the theory were recognized for their major contributions; physicists Alan Guth of M.I.T., Andrei Linde of Stanford, and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton shared the Dirac Prize "for development of the concept of inflation in cosmology". In 2012, Guth and Linde were awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their invention and development of inflationary cosmology.\n== Overview ==\nAround 1930, Edwin Hubble discovered that light from remote galaxies was redshifted; the more remote, the more shifted. This implies that the galaxies are receding from the Earth, with more distant galaxies receding more rapidly, such that galaxies also recede from each other. This expansion of the universe was previously predicted by Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lemaître from the theory of general relativity. It can be understood as a consequence of an initial impulse, which sent the contents of the universe flying apart at such a rate that their mutual gravitational attraction has not reversed their increasing separation.\nInflation may have provided this initial impulse. According to the Friedmann equations that describe the dynamics of an expanding universe, a fluid with sufficiently negative pressure exerts gravitational repulsion in the cosmological context. A field in a positive-energy false vacuum state could represent such a fluid, and the resulting repulsion would set the universe into exponential expansion. This inflation phase was originally proposed by Alan Guth in 1979 because the exponential expansion could dilute exotic relics, such as magnetic monopoles, that were predicted by grand unified theories at the time. This would explain why such relics were not seen. It was quickly realized that such accelerated expansion would resolve the horizon problem and the flatness problem. These problems arise from the notion that to look like it does today, the Universe must have started from very finely tuned, or "special", initial conditions at the Big Bang.\n== Theory ==\nAn expanding universe generally has a cosmological horizon, which, by analogy with the more familiar horizon caused by the curvature of Earth\'s surface, marks the boundary of the part of the Universe that an observer can see. Light (or other radiation) emitted by objects beyond the cosmological horizon in an accelerating universe never reaches the observer, because the space in between the observer and the object is expanding too rapidly.\nThe observable universe is one causal patch of a much larger unobservable universe; other parts of the Universe cannot communicate with Earth yet. These parts of the Universe are outside our current cosmological horizon, which is believed to be 46 billion light years in all directions from Earth. In the standard hot big bang model, without inflation, the cosmological horizon moves out, bringing new regions into view. Yet as a local observer sees such a region for the first time, it looks no different from any other region of space the local observer has already seen: Its background radiation is at nearly the same temperature as the background radiation of other regions, and its space-time curvature is evolving lock-step with the others. This presents a mystery: how did these new regions know what temperature and curvature they were supposed to have? They could not have learned it by getting signals, because they were not previously in communication with our past light cone.\nInflation answers this question by postulating that all the regions come from an earlier era with a big vacuum energy, or cosmological constant. A space with a cosmological constant is qualitatively different: instead of moving outward, the cosmological horizon stays put. For any one observer, the distance to the cosmological horizon is constant. With exponentially expanding space, two nearby observers are separated very quickly; so much so, that the distance between them quickly exceeds the limits of communication. The spatial slices are expanding very fast to cover huge volumes. Things are constantly moving beyond the cosmological horizon, which is a fixed distance away, and everything becomes homogeneous.\nAs the inflationary field slowly relaxes to the vacuum, the cosmological constant goes to zero and space begins to expand normally. The new regions that come into view during the normal expansion phase are exactly the same regions that were pushed out of the horizon during inflation, and so they are at nearly the same temperature and curvature, because they come from the same originally small patch of space.\nThe theory of inflation thus explains why the temperatures and curvatures of different regions are so nearly equal. It also predicts that the total curvature of a space-slice at constant global time is zero. This prediction implies that the total ordinary matter, dark matter and residual vacuum energy in the Universe have to add up to the critical density, and the evidence supports this. More strikingly, inflation allows physicists to calculate the minute differences in temperature of different regions from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era, and many of these quantitative predictions have been confirmed.\n=== Space expands ===\nIn a space that expands exponentially (or nearly exponentially) with time, any pair of free-floating objects that are initially at rest will move apart from each other at an accelerating rate, at least as long as they are not bound together by any force. From the point of view of one such object, the spacetime is something like an inside-out Schwarzschild black hole—each object is surrounded by a spherical event horizon. Once the other object has fallen through this horizon it can never return, and even light signals it sends will never reach the first object (at least so long as the space continues to expand exponentially).\nIn the approximation that the expansion is exactly exponential, the horizon is static and remains a fixed physical distance away. This patch of an inflating universe can be described by the following metric:\n{\\displaystyle ds^{2}=-(1-\\Lambda r^{2})\\,c^{2}dt^{2}+{1 \\over 1-\\Lambda r^{2}}\\,dr^{2}+r^{2}\\,d\\Omega ^{2}.}\nThis exponentially expanding spacetime is called a de Sitter space, and to sustain it there must be a cosmological constant, a vacuum energy density that is constant in space and time and proportional to Λ in the above metric. For the case of exactly exponential expansion, the vacuum energy has a negative pressure p equal in magnitude to its energy density ρ; the equation of state is p=−ρ.\nInflation is typically not an exactly exponential expansion, but rather quasi- or near-exponential. In such a universe the horizon will slowly grow with time as the vacuum energy density gradually decreases.\n=== Few inhomogeneities remain ===\nBecause the accelerating expansion of space stretches out any initial variations in density or temperature to very large length scales, an essential feature of inflation is that it smooths out inhomogeneities and anisotropies, and reduces the curvature of space. This pushes the Universe into a very simple state in which it is completely dominated by the inflaton field and the only significant inhomogeneities are tiny quantum fluctuations. Inflation also dilutes exotic heavy particles, such as the magnetic monopoles predicted by many extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics. If the Universe was only hot enough to form such particles before a period of inflation, they would not be observed in nature, as they would be so rare that it is quite likely that there are none in the observable universe. Together, these effects are called the inflationary "no-hair theorem" by analogy with the no hair theorem for black holes.', 'In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the very early universe. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate.

This prediction implies that the total ordinary matter, dark matter and residual vacuum energy in the Universe have to add up to the critical density, and the evidence supports this. More strikingly, inflation allows physicists to calculate the minute differences in temperature of different regions from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era, and many of these quantitative predictions have been confirmed.\n=== Space expands ===\nIn a space that expands exponentially (or nearly exponentially) with time, any pair of free-floating objects that are initially at rest will move apart from each other at an accelerating rate, at least as long as they are not bound together by any force. From the point of view of one such object, the spacetime is something like an inside-out Schwarzschild black hole—each object is surrounded by a spherical event horizon. Once the other object has fallen through this horizon it can never return, and even light signals it sends will never reach the first object (at least so long as the space continues to expand exponentially).\nIn the approximation that the expansion is exactly exponential, the horizon is static and remains a fixed physical distance away. This patch of an inflating universe can be described by the following metric:\n{\\displaystyle ds^{2}=-(1-\\Lambda r^{2})\\,c^{2}dt^{2}+{1 \\over 1-\\Lambda r^{2}}\\,dr^{2}+r^{2}\\,d\\Omega ^{2}.}\nThis exponentially expanding spacetime is called a de Sitter space, and to sustain it there must be a cosmological constant, a vacuum energy density that is constant in space and time and proportional to Λ in the above metric. For the case of exactly exponential expansion, the vacuum energy has a negative pressure p equal in magnitude to its energy density ρ; the equation of state is p=−ρ.\nInflation is typically not an exactly exponential expansion, but rather quasi- or near-exponential. In such a universe the horizon will slowly grow with time as the vacuum energy density gradually decreases.\n=== Few inhomogeneities remain ===\nBecause the accelerating expansion of space stretches out any initial variations in density or temperature to very large length scales, an essential feature of inflation is that it smooths out inhomogeneities and anisotropies, and reduces the curvature of space. This pushes the Universe into a very simple state in which it is completely dominated by the inflaton field and the only significant inhomogeneities are tiny quantum fluctuations. Inflation also dilutes exotic heavy particles, such as the magnetic monopoles predicted by many extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics. If the Universe was only hot enough to form such particles before a period of inflation, they would not be observed in nature, as they would be so rare that it is quite likely that there are none in the observable universe. Together, these effects are called the inflationary "no-hair theorem" by analogy with the no hair theorem for black holes.', 'In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the very early universe. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. The re-acceleration of this slowing expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago).\nInflation theory was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with notable contributions by several theoretical physicists, including Alexei Starobinsky at Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Alan Guth at Cornell University, and Andrei Linde at Lebedev Physical Institute. Starobinsky, Guth, and Linde won the 2014 Kavli Prize "for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation". It was developed further in the early 1980s. It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.\nThe detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown. A number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation; for example temperature anisotropies observed by the COBE satellite in 1992 exhibit nearly scale-invariant spectra as predicted by the inflationary paradigm and WMAP results also show strong evidence for inflation. However, some scientists dissent from this position. The hypothetical field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton.\nIn 2002, three of the original architects of the theory were recognized for their major contributions; physicists Alan Guth of M.I.T., Andrei Linde of Stanford, and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton shared the Dirac Prize "for development of the concept of inflation in cosmology". In 2012, Guth and Linde were awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their invention and development of inflationary cosmology.\n== Overview ==\nAround 1930, Edwin Hubble discovered that light from remote galaxies was redshifted; the more remote, the more shifted. This implies that the galaxies are receding from the Earth, with more distant galaxies receding more rapidly, such that galaxies also recede from each other. This expansion of the universe was previously predicted by Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lemaître from the theory of general relativity. It can be understood as a consequence of an initial impulse, which sent the contents of the universe flying apart at such a rate that their mutual gravitational attraction has not reversed their increasing separation.\nInflation may have provided this initial impulse. According to the Friedmann equations that describe the dynamics of an expanding universe, a fluid with sufficiently negative pressure exerts gravitational repulsion in the cosmological context. A field in a positive-energy false vacuum state could represent such a fluid, and the resulting repulsion would set the universe into exponential expansion. This inflation phase was originally proposed by Alan Guth in 1979 because the exponential expansion could dilute exotic relics, such as magnetic monopoles, that were predicted by grand unified theories at the time. This would explain why such relics were not seen. It was quickly realized that such accelerated expansion would resolve the horizon problem and the flatness problem. These problems arise from the notion that to look like it does today, the Universe must have started from very finely tuned, or "special", initial conditions at the Big Bang.\n== Theory ==\nAn expanding universe generally has a cosmological horizon, which, by analogy with the more familiar horizon caused by the curvature of Earth\'s surface, marks the boundary of the part of the Universe that an observer can see. Light (or other radiation) emitted by objects beyond the cosmological horizon in an accelerating universe never reaches the observer, because the space in between the observer and the object is expanding too rapidly.\nThe observable universe is one causal patch of a much larger unobservable universe; other parts of the Universe cannot communicate with Earth yet. These parts of the Universe are outside our current cosmological horizon, which is believed to be 46 billion light years in all directions from Earth. In the standard hot big bang model, without inflation, the cosmological horizon moves out, bringing new regions into view. Yet as a local observer sees such a region for the first time, it looks no different from any other region of space the local observer has already seen: Its background radiation is at nearly the same temperature as the background radiation of other regions, and its space-time curvature is evolving lock-step with the others. This presents a mystery: how did these new regions know what temperature and curvature they were supposed to have? They could not have learned it by getting signals, because they were not previously in communication with our past light cone.\nInflation answers this question by postulating that all the regions come from an earlier era with a big vacuum energy, or cosmological constant. A space with a cosmological constant is qualitatively different: instead of moving outward, the cosmological horizon stays put. For any one observer, the distance to the cosmological horizon is constant. With exponentially expanding space, two nearby observers are separated very quickly; so much so, that the distance between them quickly exceeds the limits of communication. The spatial slices are expanding very fast to cover huge volumes. Things are constantly moving beyond the cosmological horizon, which is a fixed distance away, and everything becomes homogeneous.\nAs the inflationary field slowly relaxes to the vacuum, the cosmological constant goes to zero and space begins to expand normally. The new regions that come into view during the normal expansion phase are exactly the same regions that were pushed out of the horizon during inflation, and so they are at nearly the same temperature and curvature, because they come from the same originally small patch of space.\nThe theory of inflation thus explains why the temperatures and curvatures of different regions are so nearly equal. It also predicts that the total curvature of a space-slice at constant global time is zero. This prediction implies that the total ordinary matter, dark matter and residual vacuum energy in the Universe have to add up to the critical density, and the evidence supports this.

In less dramatic situations, such as in a solar cell under constant illumination, a quasi-equilibrium description may be possible but requiring the assignment of distinct values of μ and T to different bands (conduction band vs. valence band). Even then, the values of μ and T may jump discontinuously across a material interface (e.g., p–n junction) when a current is being driven, and be ill-defined at the interface itself.\n== Technicalities ==\n=== Nomenclature ===\nThe term Fermi level is mainly used in discussing the solid state physics of electrons in semiconductors, and a precise usage of this term is necessary to describe band diagrams in devices comprising different materials with different levels of doping.\nIn these contexts, however, one may also see Fermi level used imprecisely to refer to the band-referenced Fermi level, μ − ϵC, called ζ above.\nIt is common to see scientists and engineers refer to "controlling", "pinning", or "tuning" the Fermi level inside a conductor, when they are in fact describing changes in ϵC due to doping or the field effect.\nIn fact, thermodynamic equilibrium guarantees that the Fermi level in a conductor is always fixed to be exactly equal to the Fermi level of the electrodes; only the band structure (not the Fermi level) can be changed by doping or the field effect (see also band diagram).\nA similar ambiguity exists between the terms, chemical potential and electrochemical potential.\nIt is also important to note that Fermi level is not necessarily the same thing as Fermi energy.\nIn the wider context of quantum mechanics, the term Fermi energy usually refers to the maximum kinetic energy of a fermion in an idealized non-interacting, disorder free, zero temperature Fermi gas.\nThis concept is very theoretical (there is no such thing as a non-interacting Fermi gas, and zero temperature is impossible to achieve). However, it finds some use in approximately describing white dwarfs, neutron stars, atomic nuclei, and electrons in a metal.\nOn the other hand, in the fields of semiconductor physics and engineering, Fermi energy often is used to refer to the Fermi level described in this article.\n=== Fermi level referencing and the location of zero Fermi level ===\nMuch like the choice of origin in a coordinate system, the zero point of energy can be defined arbitrarily. Observable phenomena only depend on energy differences.\nWhen comparing distinct bodies, however, it is important that they all be consistent in their choice of the location of zero energy, or else nonsensical results will be obtained.\nIt can therefore be helpful to explicitly name a common point to ensure that different components are in agreement.\nOn the other hand, if a reference point is inherently ambiguous (such as "the vacuum", see below) it will instead cause more problems.\nA practical and well-justified choice of common point is a bulky, physical conductor, such as the electrical ground or earth.\nSuch a conductor can be considered to be in a good thermodynamic equilibrium and so its μ is well defined.\nIt provides a reservoir of charge, so that large numbers of electrons may be added or removed without incurring charging effects.\nIt also has the advantage of being accessible, so that the Fermi level of any other object can be measured simply with a voltmeter.\n==== Why it is not advisable to use "the energy in vacuum" as a reference zero ====\nIn principle, one might consider using the state of a stationary electron in the vacuum as a reference point for energies.\nThis approach is not advisable unless one is careful to define exactly where the vacuum is. The problem is that not all points in the vacuum are equivalent.\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, it is typical for electrical potential differences of order 1 V to exist in the vacuum (Volta potentials).\nThe source of this vacuum potential variation is the variation in work function between the different conducting materials exposed to vacuum.\nJust outside a conductor, the electrostatic potential depends sensitively on the material, as well as which surface is selected (its crystal orientation, contamination, and other details).\nThe parameter that gives the best approximation to universality is the Earth-referenced Fermi level suggested above. This also has the advantage that it can be measured with a voltmeter.\n=== Discrete charging effects in small systems ===\nIn cases where the "charging effects" due to a single electron are non-negligible, the above definitions should be clarified. For example, consider a capacitor made of two identical parallel-plates. If the capacitor is uncharged, the Fermi level is the same on both sides, so one might think that it should take no energy to move an electron from one plate to the other. But when the electron has been moved, the capacitor has become (slightly) charged, so this does take a slight amount of energy. In a normal capacitor, this is negligible, but in a nano-scale capacitor it can be more important.\nIn this case one must be precise about the thermodynamic definition of the chemical potential as well as the state of the device: is it electrically isolated, or is it connected to an electrode?\nWhen the body is able to exchange electrons and energy with an electrode (reservoir), it is described by the grand canonical ensemble. The value of chemical potential μ can be said to be fixed by the electrode, and the number of electrons N on the body may fluctuate. In this case, the chemical potential of a body is the infinitesimal amount of work needed to increase the average number of electrons by an infinitesimal amount (even though the number of electrons at any time is an integer, the average number varies continuously.):\n{\\displaystyle \\mu (\\left\\langle N\\right\\rangle ,T)=\\left({\\frac {\\partial F}{\\partial \\left\\langle N\\right\\rangle }}\\right)_{T},}\nwhere\n{\\displaystyle F(N,T)=\\Omega (N,T)+\\mu N}\nis the Helmholtz free energy of the grand canonical ensemble.\nIf the number of electrons in the body is fixed (but the body is still thermally connected to a heat bath), then it is in the canonical ensemble. We can define a "chemical potential" in this case literally as the work required to add one electron to a body that already has exactly N electrons,\n{\\displaystyle \\mu \'(N,T)=F(N+1,T)-F(N,T),}\nwhere F(N, T) is the free energy function of the canonical ensemble, alternatively,\n{\\displaystyle \\mu \'\'(N,T)=F(N,T)-F(N-1,T)=\\mu \'(N-1,T).}\nThese chemical potentials are not equivalent, μ ≠ μ′ ≠ μ″, except in the thermodynamic limit. The distinction is important in small systems such as those showing Coulomb blockade, but technically affects large sized semiconductors at zero temperature, at least ideally.\nThe parameter, μ, (i.e., in the case where the number of electrons is allowed to fluctuate) remains exactly related to the voltmeter voltage, even in small systems.\nTo be precise, then, the Fermi level is defined not by a deterministic charging event by one electron charge, but rather a statistical charging event by an infinitesimal fraction of an electron.\n== Notes ==\n== References ==', 'Under illumination from a light-source with a different temperature, such as the sun (as in solar cells),\nWhen the temperature is not constant within the device (as in thermocouples),\nWhen the device has been altered, but has not had enough time to re-equilibrate (as in piezoelectric or pyroelectric substances).\nIn some situations, such as immediately after a material experiences a high-energy laser pulse, the electron distribution cannot be described by any thermal distribution.\nOne cannot define the quasi-Fermi level or quasi-temperature in this case; the electrons are simply said to be non-thermalized.

This also has the advantage that it can be measured with a voltmeter.\n=== Discrete charging effects in small systems ===\nIn cases where the "charging effects" due to a single electron are non-negligible, the above definitions should be clarified. For example, consider a capacitor made of two identical parallel-plates. If the capacitor is uncharged, the Fermi level is the same on both sides, so one might think that it should take no energy to move an electron from one plate to the other. But when the electron has been moved, the capacitor has become (slightly) charged, so this does take a slight amount of energy. In a normal capacitor, this is negligible, but in a nano-scale capacitor it can be more important.\nIn this case one must be precise about the thermodynamic definition of the chemical potential as well as the state of the device: is it electrically isolated, or is it connected to an electrode?\nWhen the body is able to exchange electrons and energy with an electrode (reservoir), it is described by the grand canonical ensemble. The value of chemical potential μ can be said to be fixed by the electrode, and the number of electrons N on the body may fluctuate. In this case, the chemical potential of a body is the infinitesimal amount of work needed to increase the average number of electrons by an infinitesimal amount (even though the number of electrons at any time is an integer, the average number varies continuously.):\n{\\displaystyle \\mu (\\left\\langle N\\right\\rangle ,T)=\\left({\\frac {\\partial F}{\\partial \\left\\langle N\\right\\rangle }}\\right)_{T},}\nwhere\n{\\displaystyle F(N,T)=\\Omega (N,T)+\\mu N}\nis the Helmholtz free energy of the grand canonical ensemble.\nIf the number of electrons in the body is fixed (but the body is still thermally connected to a heat bath), then it is in the canonical ensemble. We can define a "chemical potential" in this case literally as the work required to add one electron to a body that already has exactly N electrons,\n{\\displaystyle \\mu \'(N,T)=F(N+1,T)-F(N,T),}\nwhere F(N, T) is the free energy function of the canonical ensemble, alternatively,\n{\\displaystyle \\mu \'\'(N,T)=F(N,T)-F(N-1,T)=\\mu \'(N-1,T).}\nThese chemical potentials are not equivalent, μ ≠ μ′ ≠ μ″, except in the thermodynamic limit. The distinction is important in small systems such as those showing Coulomb blockade, but technically affects large sized semiconductors at zero temperature, at least ideally.\nThe parameter, μ, (i.e., in the case where the number of electrons is allowed to fluctuate) remains exactly related to the voltmeter voltage, even in small systems.\nTo be precise, then, the Fermi level is defined not by a deterministic charging event by one electron charge, but rather a statistical charging event by an infinitesimal fraction of an electron.\n== Notes ==\n== References ==', 'Under illumination from a light-source with a different temperature, such as the sun (as in solar cells),\nWhen the temperature is not constant within the device (as in thermocouples),\nWhen the device has been altered, but has not had enough time to re-equilibrate (as in piezoelectric or pyroelectric substances).\nIn some situations, such as immediately after a material experiences a high-energy laser pulse, the electron distribution cannot be described by any thermal distribution.\nOne cannot define the quasi-Fermi level or quasi-temperature in this case; the electrons are simply said to be non-thermalized. In less dramatic situations, such as in a solar cell under constant illumination, a quasi-equilibrium description may be possible but requiring the assignment of distinct values of μ and T to different bands (conduction band vs. valence band). Even then, the values of μ and T may jump discontinuously across a material interface (e.g., p–n junction) when a current is being driven, and be ill-defined at the interface itself.\n== Technicalities ==\n=== Nomenclature ===\nThe term Fermi level is mainly used in discussing the solid state physics of electrons in semiconductors, and a precise usage of this term is necessary to describe band diagrams in devices comprising different materials with different levels of doping.\nIn these contexts, however, one may also see Fermi level used imprecisely to refer to the band-referenced Fermi level, μ − ϵC, called ζ above.\nIt is common to see scientists and engineers refer to "controlling", "pinning", or "tuning" the Fermi level inside a conductor, when they are in fact describing changes in ϵC due to doping or the field effect.\nIn fact, thermodynamic equilibrium guarantees that the Fermi level in a conductor is always fixed to be exactly equal to the Fermi level of the electrodes; only the band structure (not the Fermi level) can be changed by doping or the field effect (see also band diagram).\nA similar ambiguity exists between the terms, chemical potential and electrochemical potential.\nIt is also important to note that Fermi level is not necessarily the same thing as Fermi energy.\nIn the wider context of quantum mechanics, the term Fermi energy usually refers to the maximum kinetic energy of a fermion in an idealized non-interacting, disorder free, zero temperature Fermi gas.\nThis concept is very theoretical (there is no such thing as a non-interacting Fermi gas, and zero temperature is impossible to achieve). However, it finds some use in approximately describing white dwarfs, neutron stars, atomic nuclei, and electrons in a metal.\nOn the other hand, in the fields of semiconductor physics and engineering, Fermi energy often is used to refer to the Fermi level described in this article.\n=== Fermi level referencing and the location of zero Fermi level ===\nMuch like the choice of origin in a coordinate system, the zero point of energy can be defined arbitrarily. Observable phenomena only depend on energy differences.\nWhen comparing distinct bodies, however, it is important that they all be consistent in their choice of the location of zero energy, or else nonsensical results will be obtained.\nIt can therefore be helpful to explicitly name a common point to ensure that different components are in agreement.\nOn the other hand, if a reference point is inherently ambiguous (such as "the vacuum", see below) it will instead cause more problems.\nA practical and well-justified choice of common point is a bulky, physical conductor, such as the electrical ground or earth.\nSuch a conductor can be considered to be in a good thermodynamic equilibrium and so its μ is well defined.\nIt provides a reservoir of charge, so that large numbers of electrons may be added or removed without incurring charging effects.\nIt also has the advantage of being accessible, so that the Fermi level of any other object can be measured simply with a voltmeter.\n==== Why it is not advisable to use "the energy in vacuum" as a reference zero ====\nIn principle, one might consider using the state of a stationary electron in the vacuum as a reference point for energies.\nThis approach is not advisable unless one is careful to define exactly where the vacuum is.

Given the following question, context, and choices, carefully analyze each choice to determine which one is correct. Break down the problem step by step:

Context: ['Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed circumstellar disc. When the density and temperature are high enough, deuterium fusion begins, and the outward pressure of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to "rain" onto the protostar. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called Herbig–Haro objects. This is probably the means by which excess angular momentum of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.\nWhen the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a pre-main-sequence star (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is (gravitational contraction)Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram. The contraction will proceed until the Hayashi limit is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than 0.5 M☉ thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the Henyey track.\nFinally, hydrogen begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star\'s main sequence phase on the H–R diagram.\nThe stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around 1 M☉ or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars is studied in stellar evolution.\n== Observations ==\nKey elements of star formation are only available by observing in wavelengths other than the optical. The protostellar stage of stellar existence is almost invariably hidden away deep inside dense clouds of gas and dust left over from the GMC. Often, these star-forming cocoons known as Bok globules, can be seen in silhouette against bright emission from surrounding gas. Early stages of a star\'s life can be seen in infrared light, which penetrates the dust more easily than visible light.\nObservations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have thus been especially important for unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their parent star clusters.  Examples of such embedded star clusters are FSR 1184, FSR 1190, Camargo 14, Camargo 74, Majaess 64, and Majaess 98.\nThe structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR extinction maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and rotational transitions of CO and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and submillimeter range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in infrared astronomy wavelengths, as the extinction caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth\'s atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.\nX-ray observations have proven useful for studying young stars, since X-ray emission from these objects is about 100–100,000 times stronger than X-ray emission from main-sequence stars. The earliest detections of X-rays from T Tauri stars were made by the Einstein X-ray Observatory. For low-mass stars X-rays are generated by the heating of the stellar corona through magnetic reconnection, while for high-mass O and early B-type stars X-rays are generated through supersonic shocks in the stellar winds. Photons in the soft X-ray energy range covered by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton may penetrate the interstellar medium with only moderate absorption due to gas, making the X-ray a useful wavelength for seeing the stellar populations within molecular clouds. X-ray emission as evidence of stellar youth makes this band particularly useful for performing censuses of stars in star-forming regions, given that not all young stars have infrared excesses. X-ray observations have provided near-complete censuses of all stellar-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster and Taurus Molecular Cloud.\nThe formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in the Milky Way Galaxy, but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected through its unique spectral signature.\nInitial research indicates star-forming clumps start as giant, dense areas in turbulent gas-rich matter in young galaxies, live about 500 million years, and may migrate to the center of a galaxy, creating the central bulge of a galaxy.\nOn February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.\nIn February 2018, astronomers reported, for the first time, a signal of the reionization epoch, an indirect detection of light from the earliest stars formed - about 180 million years after the Big Bang.\nAn article published on October 22, 2019, reported on the detection of 3MM-1, a massive star-forming galaxy about 12.5 billion light-years away that is obscured by clouds of dust. At a mass of about 1010.8 solar masses, it showed a star formation rate about 100 times as high as in the Milky Way.\n=== Notable pathfinder objects ===\nMWC 349 was first discovered in 1978, and is estimated to be only 1,000 years old.\nVLA 1623 – The first exemplar Class 0 protostar, a type of embedded protostar that has yet to accrete the majority of its mass. Found in 1993, is possibly younger than 10,000 years.\nL1014 – An extremely faint embedded object representative of a new class of sources that are only now being detected with the newest telescopes. Their status is still undetermined, they could be the youngest low-mass Class 0 protostars yet seen or even very low-mass evolved objects (like brown dwarfs or even rogue planets).\nGCIRS 8* – The youngest known main sequence star in the Galactic Center region, discovered in August 2006. It is estimated to be 3.5 million years old.\n== Low mass and high mass star formation ==\nStars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by observation, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about 8 M☉, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.\nMassive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this radiation pressure might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses. Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar. Present thinking is that massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that by which low mass stars form.\nThere is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Disk accretion in high-mass protostars, similar to their low-mass counterparts, is expected to exhibit bursts of episodic accretion as a result of a gravitationally instability leading to clumpy and in-continuous accretion rates. Recent evidence of accretion bursts in high-mass protostars has indeed been confirmed observationally. Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.\nAnother theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.\n== Filamentary nature of star formation ==\nRecent studies have emphasized the role of filamentary structures in molecular clouds as the initial conditions for star formation. Findings from the Herschel Space Observatory highlight the ubiquitous nature of these filaments in the cold interstellar medium (ISM). The spatial relationship between cores and filaments indicates that the majority of prestellar cores are located within 0.1 pc of supercritical filaments. This supports the hypothesis that filamentary structures act as pathways for the accumulation of gas and dust, leading to core formation.', 'Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed circumstellar disc.

For low-mass stars X-rays are generated by the heating of the stellar corona through magnetic reconnection, while for high-mass O and early B-type stars X-rays are generated through supersonic shocks in the stellar winds. Photons in the soft X-ray energy range covered by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton may penetrate the interstellar medium with only moderate absorption due to gas, making the X-ray a useful wavelength for seeing the stellar populations within molecular clouds. X-ray emission as evidence of stellar youth makes this band particularly useful for performing censuses of stars in star-forming regions, given that not all young stars have infrared excesses. X-ray observations have provided near-complete censuses of all stellar-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster and Taurus Molecular Cloud.\nThe formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in the Milky Way Galaxy, but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected through its unique spectral signature.\nInitial research indicates star-forming clumps start as giant, dense areas in turbulent gas-rich matter in young galaxies, live about 500 million years, and may migrate to the center of a galaxy, creating the central bulge of a galaxy.\nOn February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.\nIn February 2018, astronomers reported, for the first time, a signal of the reionization epoch, an indirect detection of light from the earliest stars formed - about 180 million years after the Big Bang.\nAn article published on October 22, 2019, reported on the detection of 3MM-1, a massive star-forming galaxy about 12.5 billion light-years away that is obscured by clouds of dust. At a mass of about 1010.8 solar masses, it showed a star formation rate about 100 times as high as in the Milky Way.\n=== Notable pathfinder objects ===\nMWC 349 was first discovered in 1978, and is estimated to be only 1,000 years old.\nVLA 1623 – The first exemplar Class 0 protostar, a type of embedded protostar that has yet to accrete the majority of its mass. Found in 1993, is possibly younger than 10,000 years.\nL1014 – An extremely faint embedded object representative of a new class of sources that are only now being detected with the newest telescopes. Their status is still undetermined, they could be the youngest low-mass Class 0 protostars yet seen or even very low-mass evolved objects (like brown dwarfs or even rogue planets).\nGCIRS 8* – The youngest known main sequence star in the Galactic Center region, discovered in August 2006. It is estimated to be 3.5 million years old.\n== Low mass and high mass star formation ==\nStars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by observation, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about 8 M☉, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.\nMassive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this radiation pressure might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses. Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar. Present thinking is that massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that by which low mass stars form.\nThere is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Disk accretion in high-mass protostars, similar to their low-mass counterparts, is expected to exhibit bursts of episodic accretion as a result of a gravitationally instability leading to clumpy and in-continuous accretion rates. Recent evidence of accretion bursts in high-mass protostars has indeed been confirmed observationally. Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.\nAnother theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.\n== Filamentary nature of star formation ==\nRecent studies have emphasized the role of filamentary structures in molecular clouds as the initial conditions for star formation. Findings from the Herschel Space Observatory highlight the ubiquitous nature of these filaments in the cold interstellar medium (ISM). The spatial relationship between cores and filaments indicates that the majority of prestellar cores are located within 0.1 pc of supercritical filaments. This supports the hypothesis that filamentary structures act as pathways for the accumulation of gas and dust, leading to core formation.']

Context: ['In physics, chemistry, and other related fields like biology, a phase transition (or phase change) is the physical process of transition between one state of a medium and another. Commonly the term is used to refer to changes among the basic states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, and in rare cases, plasma. A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change as a result of the change of external conditions, such as temperature or pressure. This can be a discontinuous change; for example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to its boiling point, resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The identification of the external conditions at which a transformation occurs defines the phase transition point.\n== Types of phase transition ==\n=== States of matter ===\nPhase transitions commonly refer to when a substance transforms between one of the four states of matter to another. At the phase transition point for a substance, for instance the boiling point, the two phases involved - liquid and vapor, have identical free energies and therefore are equally likely to exist. Below the boiling point, the liquid is the more stable state of the two, whereas above the boiling point the gaseous form is the more stable.\nCommon transitions between the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a single component, due to the effects of temperature and/or pressure are identified in the following table:\nFor a single component, the most stable phase at different temperatures and pressures can be shown on a phase diagram. Such a diagram usually depicts states in equilibrium. A phase transition usually occurs when the pressure or temperature changes and the system crosses from one region to another, like water turning from liquid to solid as soon as the temperature drops below the freezing point. In exception to the usual case, it is sometimes possible to change the state of a system diabatically (as opposed to adiabatically) in such a way that it can be brought past a phase transition point without undergoing a phase transition. The resulting state is metastable, i.e., less stable than the phase to which the transition would have occurred, but not unstable either. This occurs in superheating and supercooling, for example. Metastable states do not appear on usual phase diagrams.\n=== Structural ===\nPhase transitions can also occur when a solid changes to a different structure without changing its chemical makeup. In elements, this is known as allotropy, whereas in compounds it is known as polymorphism. The change from one crystal structure to another, from a crystalline solid to an amorphous solid, or from one amorphous structure to another (polyamorphs) are all examples of solid to solid phase transitions.\nThe martensitic transformation occurs as one of the many phase transformations in carbon steel and stands as a model for displacive phase transformations. Order-disorder transitions such as in alpha-titanium aluminides. As with states of matter, there is also a metastable to equilibrium phase transformation for structural phase transitions. A metastable polymorph which forms rapidly due to lower surface energy will transform to an equilibrium phase given sufficient thermal input to overcome an energetic barrier.\n=== Magnetic ===\nPhase transitions can also describe the change between different kinds of magnetic ordering. The most well-known is the transition between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases of magnetic materials, which occurs at what is called the Curie point. Another example is the transition between differently ordered, commensurate or incommensurate, magnetic structures, such as in cerium antimonide. A simplified but highly useful model of magnetic phase transitions is provided by the Ising model.\n=== Mixtures ===\nPhase transitions involving solutions and mixtures are more complicated than transitions involving a single compound. While chemically pure compounds exhibit a single temperature melting point between solid and liquid phases, mixtures can either have a single melting point, known as congruent melting, or they have different liquidus and solidus temperatures resulting in a temperature span where solid and liquid coexist in equilibrium. This is often the case in solid solutions, where the two components are isostructural.\nThere are also a number of phase transitions involving three phases: a eutectic transformation, in which a two-component single-phase liquid is cooled and transforms into two solid phases. The same process, but beginning with a solid instead of a liquid is called a eutectoid transformation. A peritectic transformation, in which a two-component single-phase solid is heated and transforms into a solid phase and a liquid phase. A peritectoid reaction is a peritectoid reaction, except involving only solid phases. A monotectic reaction consists of change from a liquid and to a combination of a solid and a second liquid, where the two liquids display a miscibility gap.\nSeparation into multiple phases can occur via spinodal decomposition, in which a single phase is cooled and separates into two different compositions.\nNon-equilibrium mixtures can occur, such as in supersaturation.\n=== Other examples ===\nOther phase changes include:\nTransition to a mesophase between solid and liquid, such as one of the "liquid crystal" phases.\nThe dependence of the adsorption geometry on coverage and temperature, such as for hydrogen on iron (110).\nThe emergence of superconductivity in certain metals and ceramics when cooled below a critical temperature.\nThe emergence of metamaterial properties in artificial photonic media as their parameters are varied.\nQuantum condensation of bosonic fluids (Bose–Einstein condensation). The superfluid transition in liquid helium is an example of this.\nThe breaking of symmetries in the laws of physics during the early history of the universe as its temperature cooled.\nIsotope fractionation occurs during a phase transition, the ratio of light to heavy isotopes in the involved molecules changes. When water vapor condenses (an equilibrium fractionation), the heavier water isotopes (18O and 2H) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes (16O and 1H) tend toward the vapor phase.\nPhase transitions occur when the thermodynamic free energy of a system is non-analytic for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. phases). This condition generally stems from the interactions of a large number of particles in a system, and does not appear in systems that are small. Phase transitions can occur for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum phase transitions, dynamic phase transitions, and topological (structural) phase transitions. In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature. For instance, connection probability replaces temperature for percolating networks.\n== Classifications ==\n=== Ehrenfest classification ===\nPaul Ehrenfest classified phase transitions based on the behavior of the thermodynamic free energy as a function of other thermodynamic variables. Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. First-order phase transitions exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable. The various solid/liquid/gas transitions are classified as first-order transitions because they involve a discontinuous change in density, which is the (inverse of the) first derivative of the free energy with respect to pressure. Second-order phase transitions are continuous in the first derivative (the order parameter, which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy. These include the ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the magnetization, which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the Curie temperature. The magnetic susceptibility, the second derivative of the free energy with the field, changes discontinuously. Under the Ehrenfest classification scheme, there could in principle be third, fourth, and higher-order phase transitions. For example, the Gross–Witten–Wadia phase transition in 2-d lattice quantum chromodynamics is a third-order phase transition, and the Tracy–Widom distribution can be interpreted as a third-order transition. The Curie points of many ferromagnetics is also a third-order transition, as shown by their specific heat having a sudden change in slope.\nIn practice, only the first- and second-order phase transitions are typically observed. The second-order phase transition was for a while controversial, as it seems to require two sheets of the Gibbs free energy to osculate exactly, which is so unlikely as to never occur in practice. Cornelis Gorter replied the criticism by pointing out that the Gibbs free energy surface might have two sheets on one side, but only one sheet on the other side, creating a forked appearance. ( pp. 146--150)\nThe Ehrenfest classification implicitly allows for continuous phase transformations, where the bonding character of a material changes, but there is no discontinuity in any free energy derivative. An example of this occurs at the supercritical liquid–gas boundaries.', 'In physics, chemistry, and other related fields like biology, a phase transition (or phase change) is the physical process of transition between one state of a medium and another.

Given the following question, context, and choices, carefully analyze each choice to determine which one is correct. Break down the problem step by step:

Context: ['Shower-curtain effect\n\nThe shower-curtain effect in physics describes the phenomenon of a shower curtain being blown inward when a shower is running. The problem of identifying the cause of this effect has been featured in Scientific American magazine, with several theories given to explain the phenomenon but no definite conclusion.\nThe shower-curtain effect may also be used to describe the observation of how nearby phase front distortions of an optical wave are more severe than remote distortions of the same amplitude.\n== Hypotheses ==\n=== Buoyancy hypothesis ===\nAlso called chimney effect or stack effect, observes that warm air (from the hot shower) rises out over the shower curtain as cooler air (near the floor) pushes in under the curtain to replace the rising air.  By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and Coandă effects become more significant. However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this is not the sole mechanism.\n=== Bernoulli effect hypothesis ===\nThe most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli\'s principle.  Bernoulli\'s principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure.  This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a shower head causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing in the same direction as the water.  This movement would be parallel to the plane of the shower curtain.  If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli\'s principle says the air pressure there will drop.  This would result in a pressure differential between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move inward.  It would be strongest when the gap between the bather and the curtain is smallest, resulting in the curtain attaching to the bather.\n=== Horizontal vortex hypothesis ===\nA computer simulation of a typical bathroom found that none of the above theories pan out in their analysis, but instead found that the spray from the shower-head drives a horizontal vortex. This vortex has a low-pressure zone in the centre, which sucks the curtain.\nDavid Schmidt of the University of Massachusetts was awarded the 2001 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for his partial solution to the question of why shower curtains billow inwards. He used a computational fluid dynamics code to achieve the results.  Professor Schmidt is adamant that this was done "for fun" in his own free time without the use of grants.\n=== Coandă effect ===\nThe Coandă effect, also known as "boundary layer attachment", is the tendency of a moving fluid to adhere to an adjacent wall.\n=== Condensation ===\nA hot shower will produce steam that condenses on the shower side of the curtain, lowering the pressure there.  In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative.\n=== Air pressure ===\nColder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom.\n== Solutions ==\nMany shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. They may have adhesive suction cups on the bottom edges of the curtain, which are then pushed onto the sides of the shower when in use. Others may have magnets at the bottom, though these are not effective on acrylic or fiberglass tubs.\nIt is possible to use a telescopic shower curtain rod to block the curtain on its lower part and to prevent it from sucking inside.\nHanging the curtain rod higher or lower, or especially further away from the shower head, can reduce the effect. A convex shower rod can also be used to hold the curtain against the inside wall of a tub.\nA weight can be attached to a long string and the string attached to the curtain rod in the middle of the curtain (on the inside). Hanging the weight low against the curtain just above the rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it.\nThere are a few alternative solutions that either attach to the shower curtain directly, attach to the shower rod or attach to the wall.\n== References ==\n== External links ==\nScientific American: Why does the shower curtain move toward the water?\nWhy does the shower curtain blow up and in instead of down and out?\nVideo demonstration of how this phenomenon could be solved.\nThe Straight Dope: Why does the shower curtain blow in despite the water pushing it out (revisited)?\n2001 Ig Nobel Prize Winners\nFluent NEWS: Shower Curtain Grabs Scientist – But He Lives to Tell Why\nArggh, Why Does the Shower Curtain Attack Me? by Joe Palca.

Context: ['Young\'s interference experiment, also called Young\'s double-slit interferometer, was the original version of the modern double-slit experiment, performed at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Thomas Young. This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. In Young\'s own judgement, this was the most important of his many achievements.\n== Theories of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries ==\nDuring this period, many scientists proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations, including Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler.  However, Isaac Newton, who did many experimental investigations of light, had rejected the wave theory of light and developed his corpuscular theory of light according to which light is emitted from a luminous body in the form of tiny particles. This theory held sway until the beginning of the nineteenth century despite the fact that many phenomena, including diffraction effects at edges or in narrow apertures, colours in thin films and insect wings, and the apparent failure of light particles to crash into one another when two light beams crossed, could not be adequately explained by the corpuscular theory which, nonetheless, had many eminent supporters, including Pierre-Simon Laplace and Jean-Baptiste Biot.\n== Young\'s work on wave theory ==\nWhile studying medicine at Göttingen in the 1790s, Young wrote a thesis on the physical and mathematical properties of sound and in 1800, he presented a paper to the Royal Society (written in 1799) where he argued that light was also a wave motion.  His idea was greeted with a certain amount of skepticism because it contradicted Newton\'s corpuscular theory.\nNonetheless, he continued to develop his ideas. He believed that a wave model could much better explain many aspects of light propagation than the corpuscular model:\nA very extensive class of phenomena leads us still more directly to the same conclusion; they consist chiefly of the production of colours by means of transparent plates, and by diffraction or inflection, none of which have been explained upon the supposition of emanation, in a manner sufficiently minute or comprehensive to satisfy the most candid even of the advocates for the projectile system; while on the other hand all of them may be at once understood, from the effect of the interference of double lights, in a manner nearly similar to that which constitutes in sound the sensation of a beat, when two strings forming an imperfect unison, are heard to vibrate together.\nIn 1801, Young presented a famous paper to the Royal Society entitled "On the Theory of Light and Colours" which describes various interference phenomena. The first published account of what Young called his \'general law\' of interference appeared in January 1802, in his book A Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy:But the general law, by which all these appearances are governed, may be very easily deduced from the interference of two coincident undulations, which either cooperate, or destroy each other, in the same manner as two musical notes produce an alternate intension and remission, in the beating of an imperfect unison.The first of Young\'s Bakerian lectures was published in the spring of 1802. In 1803, he described his famous interference experiment. Unlike the modern double-slit experiment, Young\'s experiment reflects sunlight (using a steering mirror) through a small hole, and splits the thin beam in half using a paper card. He also mentions the possibility of passing light through two slits in his description of the experiment:\nSupposing the light of any given colour to consist of undulations of a given breadth, or of a given frequency, it follows that these undulations must be liable to those effects which we have already examined in the case of the waves of water and the pulses of sound. It has been shown that two equal series of waves, proceeding from centres near each other, may be seen to destroy each other\'s effects at certain points, and at other points to redouble them; and the beating of two sounds has been explained from a similar interference. We are now to apply the same principles to the alternate union and extinction of colours.\nIn order that the effects of two portions of light may be thus combined, it is necessary that they be derived from the same origin, and that they arrive at the same point by different paths, in directions not much deviating from each other. This deviation may be produced in one or both of the portions by diffraction, by reflection, by refraction, or by any of these effects combined; but the simplest case appears to be, when a beam of homogeneous light falls on a screen in which there are two very small holes or slits, which may be considered as centres of divergence, from whence the light is diffracted in every direction. In this case, when the two newly formed beams are received on a surface placed so as to intercept them, their light is divided by dark stripes into portions nearly equal, but becoming wider as the surface is more remote from the apertures, so as to subtend very nearly equal angles from the apertures at all distances, and wider also in the same proportion as the apertures are closer to each other. The middle of the two portions is always light, and the bright stripes on each side are at such distances, that the light coming to them from one of the apertures, must have passed through a longer space than that which comes from the other, by an interval which is equal to the breadth of one, two, three, or more of the supposed undulations, while the intervening dark spaces correspond to a difference of half a supposed undulation, of one and a half, of two and a half, or more.\nFrom a comparison of various experiments, it appears that the breadth of the undulations constituting the extreme red light must be supposed to be, in air, about one 36 thousandth of an inch, and those of the extreme violet about one 60 thousandth ; the mean of the whole spectrum, with respect to the intensity of light, being about one 45 thousandth. From these dimensions it follows, calculating upon the known velocity of light, that almost 500 millions of millions of the slowest of such undulations must enter the eye in a single second. The combination of two portions of white or mixed light, when viewed at a great distance, exhibits a few white and black stripes, corresponding to this interval: although, upon closer inspection, the distinct effects of an infinite number of stripes of different breadths appear to be compounded together, so as to produce a beautiful diversity of tints, passing by degrees into each other. The central whiteness is first changed to a yellowish, and then to a tawny colour, succeeded by crimson, and by violet and blue, which together appear, when seen at a distance, as a dark stripe; after this a green light appears, and the dark space beyond it has a crimson hue; the subsequent lights are all more or less green, the dark spaces purple and reddish; and the red light appears so far to predominate in all these effects, that the red or purple stripes occupy nearly the same place in the mixed fringes as if their light were received separately.\nThe figure shows the geometry for a far-field viewing plane. It is seen that the relative paths of the light travelling from the two points sources to a given point in the viewing plane varies with the angle θ, so that their relative phases also vary.  When the path difference is equal to an integer number of wavelengths, the two waves add together to give a maximum in the brightness, whereas when the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, or one and a half etc., then the two waves cancel, and the intensity is at a minimum.\nThe linear separation (distance) -\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta y}\nbetween fringes (lines with maximum brightness) on the screen is given by the equation :\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta y=L\\lambda /d}\nwhere\n{\\displaystyle L}\nis the distance between the slit and screen,\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\nis the wavelength of light and\n{\\displaystyle d}\nis the slit separation as shown in figure.\nThe angular spacing of the fringes, θf,  is then given by\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{f}\\approx \\lambda /d}\nwhere θf <<1, and λ is the wavelength of the light.  It can be seen that the spacing of the fringes depends on the wavelength, the separation of the holes, and the distance between the slits and the observation plane, as noted by Young.\nThis expression applies when the light source has a single wavelength, whereas Young used sunlight, and was therefore looking at white-light fringes which he describes above.  A white light fringe pattern can be considered to be made up of a set of individual fringe patterns of different colours.  These all have a maximum value in the centre, but their spacing varies with wavelength, and the superimposed patterns will vary in colour, as their maxima will occur in different places. Only two or three fringes can normally be observed. Young used this formula to estimate the wavelength of violet light to be 400 nm, and that of red light to be about twice that – results with which we would agree today.\nIn the years 1803–1804, a series of unsigned attacks on Young\'s theories appeared in the Edinburgh Review. The anonymous author (later revealed to be Henry Brougham, a founder of the Edinburgh Review) succeeded in undermining Young\'s credibility among the reading public sufficiently that a publisher who had committed to publishing Young\'s Royal Institution lectures backed out of the deal. This incident prompted Young to focus more on his medical practice and less on physics.\n== Acceptance of the wave theory of light ==', 'Young\'s interference experiment, also called Young\'s double-slit interferometer, was the original version of the modern double-slit experiment, performed at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Thomas Young.

The combination of two portions of white or mixed light, when viewed at a great distance, exhibits a few white and black stripes, corresponding to this interval: although, upon closer inspection, the distinct effects of an infinite number of stripes of different breadths appear to be compounded together, so as to produce a beautiful diversity of tints, passing by degrees into each other. The central whiteness is first changed to a yellowish, and then to a tawny colour, succeeded by crimson, and by violet and blue, which together appear, when seen at a distance, as a dark stripe; after this a green light appears, and the dark space beyond it has a crimson hue; the subsequent lights are all more or less green, the dark spaces purple and reddish; and the red light appears so far to predominate in all these effects, that the red or purple stripes occupy nearly the same place in the mixed fringes as if their light were received separately.\nThe figure shows the geometry for a far-field viewing plane. It is seen that the relative paths of the light travelling from the two points sources to a given point in the viewing plane varies with the angle θ, so that their relative phases also vary.  When the path difference is equal to an integer number of wavelengths, the two waves add together to give a maximum in the brightness, whereas when the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, or one and a half etc., then the two waves cancel, and the intensity is at a minimum.\nThe linear separation (distance) -\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta y}\nbetween fringes (lines with maximum brightness) on the screen is given by the equation :\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta y=L\\lambda /d}\nwhere\n{\\displaystyle L}\nis the distance between the slit and screen,\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\nis the wavelength of light and\n{\\displaystyle d}\nis the slit separation as shown in figure.\nThe angular spacing of the fringes, θf,  is then given by\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{f}\\approx \\lambda /d}\nwhere θf <<1, and λ is the wavelength of the light.  It can be seen that the spacing of the fringes depends on the wavelength, the separation of the holes, and the distance between the slits and the observation plane, as noted by Young.\nThis expression applies when the light source has a single wavelength, whereas Young used sunlight, and was therefore looking at white-light fringes which he describes above.  A white light fringe pattern can be considered to be made up of a set of individual fringe patterns of different colours.  These all have a maximum value in the centre, but their spacing varies with wavelength, and the superimposed patterns will vary in colour, as their maxima will occur in different places. Only two or three fringes can normally be observed. Young used this formula to estimate the wavelength of violet light to be 400 nm, and that of red light to be about twice that – results with which we would agree today.\nIn the years 1803–1804, a series of unsigned attacks on Young\'s theories appeared in the Edinburgh Review. The anonymous author (later revealed to be Henry Brougham, a founder of the Edinburgh Review) succeeded in undermining Young\'s credibility among the reading public sufficiently that a publisher who had committed to publishing Young\'s Royal Institution lectures backed out of the deal. This incident prompted Young to focus more on his medical practice and less on physics.\n== Acceptance of the wave theory of light ==', 'Young\'s interference experiment, also called Young\'s double-slit interferometer, was the original version of the modern double-slit experiment, performed at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Thomas Young. This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. In Young\'s own judgement, this was the most important of his many achievements.\n== Theories of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries ==\nDuring this period, many scientists proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations, including Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler.  However, Isaac Newton, who did many experimental investigations of light, had rejected the wave theory of light and developed his corpuscular theory of light according to which light is emitted from a luminous body in the form of tiny particles. This theory held sway until the beginning of the nineteenth century despite the fact that many phenomena, including diffraction effects at edges or in narrow apertures, colours in thin films and insect wings, and the apparent failure of light particles to crash into one another when two light beams crossed, could not be adequately explained by the corpuscular theory which, nonetheless, had many eminent supporters, including Pierre-Simon Laplace and Jean-Baptiste Biot.\n== Young\'s work on wave theory ==\nWhile studying medicine at Göttingen in the 1790s, Young wrote a thesis on the physical and mathematical properties of sound and in 1800, he presented a paper to the Royal Society (written in 1799) where he argued that light was also a wave motion.  His idea was greeted with a certain amount of skepticism because it contradicted Newton\'s corpuscular theory.\nNonetheless, he continued to develop his ideas. He believed that a wave model could much better explain many aspects of light propagation than the corpuscular model:\nA very extensive class of phenomena leads us still more directly to the same conclusion; they consist chiefly of the production of colours by means of transparent plates, and by diffraction or inflection, none of which have been explained upon the supposition of emanation, in a manner sufficiently minute or comprehensive to satisfy the most candid even of the advocates for the projectile system; while on the other hand all of them may be at once understood, from the effect of the interference of double lights, in a manner nearly similar to that which constitutes in sound the sensation of a beat, when two strings forming an imperfect unison, are heard to vibrate together.\nIn 1801, Young presented a famous paper to the Royal Society entitled "On the Theory of Light and Colours" which describes various interference phenomena. The first published account of what Young called his \'general law\' of interference appeared in January 1802, in his book A Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy:But the general law, by which all these appearances are governed, may be very easily deduced from the interference of two coincident undulations, which either cooperate, or destroy each other, in the same manner as two musical notes produce an alternate intension and remission, in the beating of an imperfect unison.The first of Young\'s Bakerian lectures was published in the spring of 1802. In 1803, he described his famous interference experiment. Unlike the modern double-slit experiment, Young\'s experiment reflects sunlight (using a steering mirror) through a small hole, and splits the thin beam in half using a paper card. He also mentions the possibility of passing light through two slits in his description of the experiment:\nSupposing the light of any given colour to consist of undulations of a given breadth, or of a given frequency, it follows that these undulations must be liable to those effects which we have already examined in the case of the waves of water and the pulses of sound. It has been shown that two equal series of waves, proceeding from centres near each other, may be seen to destroy each other\'s effects at certain points, and at other points to redouble them; and the beating of two sounds has been explained from a similar interference. We are now to apply the same principles to the alternate union and extinction of colours.\nIn order that the effects of two portions of light may be thus combined, it is necessary that they be derived from the same origin, and that they arrive at the same point by different paths, in directions not much deviating from each other. This deviation may be produced in one or both of the portions by diffraction, by reflection, by refraction, or by any of these effects combined; but the simplest case appears to be, when a beam of homogeneous light falls on a screen in which there are two very small holes or slits, which may be considered as centres of divergence, from whence the light is diffracted in every direction. In this case, when the two newly formed beams are received on a surface placed so as to intercept them, their light is divided by dark stripes into portions nearly equal, but becoming wider as the surface is more remote from the apertures, so as to subtend very nearly equal angles from the apertures at all distances, and wider also in the same proportion as the apertures are closer to each other. The middle of the two portions is always light, and the bright stripes on each side are at such distances, that the light coming to them from one of the apertures, must have passed through a longer space than that which comes from the other, by an interval which is equal to the breadth of one, two, three, or more of the supposed undulations, while the intervening dark spaces correspond to a difference of half a supposed undulation, of one and a half, of two and a half, or more.\nFrom a comparison of various experiments, it appears that the breadth of the undulations constituting the extreme red light must be supposed to be, in air, about one 36 thousandth of an inch, and those of the extreme violet about one 60 thousandth ; the mean of the whole spectrum, with respect to the intensity of light, being about one 45 thousandth.

Context: ['== Illustrations ==\n== Theory and mathematical definition ==\nRecurrence, the approximate return of a system toward its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making complex systems, such as the weather, difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.\nA dynamical system displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate. The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical. Lorenz defined sensitive dependence as follows:\nThe property characterizing an orbit (i.e., a solution) if most other orbits that pass close to it at some point do not remain close to it as time advances.\nIf M is the state space for the map\n{\\displaystyle f^{t}}\n, then\n{\\displaystyle f^{t}}\ndisplays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in M and any δ > 0, there are y in M, with distance d(. , .) such that\n{\\displaystyle 0<d(x,y)<\\delta }\nand such that\n{\\displaystyle d(f^{\\tau }(x),f^{\\tau }(y))>\\mathrm {e} ^{a\\tau }\\,d(x,y)}\nfor some positive parameter a. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point x, but it requires one positive Lyapunov exponent. In addition to a positive Lyapunov exponent, boundedness is another major feature within chaotic systems.\nThe simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the logistic map:\n{\\displaystyle x_{n+1}=4x_{n}(1-x_{n}),\\quad 0\\leq x_{0}\\leq 1,}\nwhich, unlike most chaotic maps, has a closed-form solution:\nsin\n{\\displaystyle x_{n}=\\sin ^{2}(2^{n}\\theta \\pi )}\nwhere the initial condition parameter\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\nis given by\nsin\n{\\displaystyle \\theta ={\\tfrac {1}{\\pi }}\\sin ^{-1}(x_{0}^{1/2})}\n. For rational\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\n, after a finite number of iterations\n{\\displaystyle x_{n}}\nmaps into a periodic sequence. But almost all\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\nare irrational, and, for irrational\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\n{\\displaystyle x_{n}}\nnever repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2n shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps\n{\\displaystyle x_{n}}\nfolded within the range [0, 1].\n== In physical systems ==\n=== In weather ===\n==== Overview ====\nThe butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of weather; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat wrong."\n==== Differentiating types of butterfly effects ====\nThe concept of the butterfly effect encompasses several phenomena. The two kinds of butterfly effects, including the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and the ability of a tiny perturbation to create an organized circulation at large distances, are not exactly the same. In Palmer et al., a new type of butterfly effect is introduced, highlighting the potential impact of small-scale processes on finite predictability within the Lorenz 1969 model. Additionally, the identification of ill-conditioned aspects of the Lorenz 1969 model points to a practical form of finite predictability. These two distinct mechanisms suggesting finite predictability in the Lorenz 1969 model are collectively referred to as the third kind of butterfly effect. The authors in  have considered Palmer et al.\'s suggestions and have aimed to present their perspective without raising specific contentions.\nThe third kind of butterfly effect with finite predictability, as discussed in, was primarily proposed based on a convergent geometric series, known as Lorenz\'s and Lilly\'s formulas. Ongoing discussions are addressing the validity of these two formulas for estimating predictability limits in.\nA comparison of the two kinds of butterfly effects and the third kind of butterfly effect has been documented. In recent studies, it was reported that both meteorological and non-meteorological linear models have shown that instability plays a role in producing a butterfly effect, which is characterized by brief but significant exponential growth resulting from a small disturbance.\n==== Recent debates on butterfly effects ====\nThe first kind of butterfly effect (BE1), known as SDIC (Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions), is widely recognized and demonstrated through idealized chaotic models. However, opinions differ regarding the second kind of butterfly effect, specifically the impact of a butterfly flapping its wings on tornado formation, as indicated in two 2024 articles. In more recent discussions published by Physics Today, it is acknowledged that the second kind of butterfly effect (BE2) has never been rigorously verified using a realistic weather model. While the studies suggest that BE2 is unlikely in the real atmosphere, its invalidity in this context does not negate the applicability of BE1 in other areas, such as pandemics or historical events.\nFor the third kind of butterfly effect, the limited predictability within the Lorenz 1969 model is explained by scale interactions in one article and by system ill-conditioning in another more recent study.\n==== Finite predictability in chaotic systems ====\nAccording to Lighthill (1986), the presence of SDIC (commonly known as the butterfly effect) implies that chaotic systems have a finite predictability limit. In a literature review, it was found that Lorenz\'s perspective on the predictability limit can be condensed into the following statement:\n(A). The Lorenz 1963 model qualitatively revealed the essence of a finite predictability within a chaotic system such as the atmosphere. However, it did not determine a precise limit for the predictability of the atmosphere.\n(B). In the 1960s, the two-week predictability limit was originally estimated based on a doubling time of five days in real-world models. Since then, this finding has been documented in Charney et al. (1966) and has become a consensus.\nRecently, a short video has been created to present Lorenz\'s perspective on predictability limit.\nA recent study refers to the two-week predictability limit, initially calculated in the 1960s with the Mintz-Arakawa model\'s five-day doubling time, as the "Predictability Limit Hypothesis." Inspired by Moore\'s Law, this term acknowledges the collaborative contributions of Lorenz, Mintz, and Arakawa under Charney\'s leadership. The hypothesis supports the investigation into extended-range predictions using both partial differential equation (PDE)-based physics methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.\n==== Revised perspectives on chaotic and non-chaotic systems ====\nBy revealing coexisting chaotic and non-chaotic attractors within Lorenz models, Shen and his colleagues proposed a revised view that "weather possesses chaos and order", in contrast to the conventional view of "weather is chaotic". As a result, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC) does not always appear. Namely, SDIC appears when two orbits (i.e., solutions) become the chaotic attractor; it does not appear when two orbits move toward the same point attractor. The above animation for double pendulum motion provides an analogy. For large angles of swing the motion of the pendulum is often chaotic. By comparison, for small angles of swing, motions are non-chaotic.\nMultistability is defined when a system (e.g., the double pendulum system) contains more than one bounded attractor that depends only on initial conditions. The multistability was illustrated using kayaking in Figure on the right side (i.e., Figure 1 of ) where the appearance of strong currents and a stagnant area suggests instability and local stability, respectively. As a result, when two kayaks move along strong currents, their paths display SDIC. On the other hand, when two kayaks move into a stagnant area, they become trapped, showing no typical SDIC (although a chaotic transient may occur). Such features of SDIC or no SDIC suggest two types of solutions and illustrate the nature of multistability.\nBy taking into consideration time-varying multistability that is associated with the modulation of large-scale processes (e.g., seasonal forcing) and aggregated feedback of small-scale processes (e.g., convection), the above revised view is refined as follows:\n"The atmosphere possesses chaos and order; it includes, as examples, emerging organized systems (such as tornadoes) and time varying forcing from recurrent seasons."\n=== In quantum mechanics ===', '== Illustrations ==\n== Theory and mathematical definition ==\nRecurrence, the approximate return of a system toward its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion.

They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat wrong."\n==== Differentiating types of butterfly effects ====\nThe concept of the butterfly effect encompasses several phenomena. The two kinds of butterfly effects, including the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and the ability of a tiny perturbation to create an organized circulation at large distances, are not exactly the same. In Palmer et al., a new type of butterfly effect is introduced, highlighting the potential impact of small-scale processes on finite predictability within the Lorenz 1969 model. Additionally, the identification of ill-conditioned aspects of the Lorenz 1969 model points to a practical form of finite predictability. These two distinct mechanisms suggesting finite predictability in the Lorenz 1969 model are collectively referred to as the third kind of butterfly effect. The authors in  have considered Palmer et al.\'s suggestions and have aimed to present their perspective without raising specific contentions.\nThe third kind of butterfly effect with finite predictability, as discussed in, was primarily proposed based on a convergent geometric series, known as Lorenz\'s and Lilly\'s formulas. Ongoing discussions are addressing the validity of these two formulas for estimating predictability limits in.\nA comparison of the two kinds of butterfly effects and the third kind of butterfly effect has been documented. In recent studies, it was reported that both meteorological and non-meteorological linear models have shown that instability plays a role in producing a butterfly effect, which is characterized by brief but significant exponential growth resulting from a small disturbance.\n==== Recent debates on butterfly effects ====\nThe first kind of butterfly effect (BE1), known as SDIC (Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions), is widely recognized and demonstrated through idealized chaotic models. However, opinions differ regarding the second kind of butterfly effect, specifically the impact of a butterfly flapping its wings on tornado formation, as indicated in two 2024 articles. In more recent discussions published by Physics Today, it is acknowledged that the second kind of butterfly effect (BE2) has never been rigorously verified using a realistic weather model. While the studies suggest that BE2 is unlikely in the real atmosphere, its invalidity in this context does not negate the applicability of BE1 in other areas, such as pandemics or historical events.\nFor the third kind of butterfly effect, the limited predictability within the Lorenz 1969 model is explained by scale interactions in one article and by system ill-conditioning in another more recent study.\n==== Finite predictability in chaotic systems ====\nAccording to Lighthill (1986), the presence of SDIC (commonly known as the butterfly effect) implies that chaotic systems have a finite predictability limit. In a literature review, it was found that Lorenz\'s perspective on the predictability limit can be condensed into the following statement:\n(A). The Lorenz 1963 model qualitatively revealed the essence of a finite predictability within a chaotic system such as the atmosphere. However, it did not determine a precise limit for the predictability of the atmosphere.\n(B). In the 1960s, the two-week predictability limit was originally estimated based on a doubling time of five days in real-world models. Since then, this finding has been documented in Charney et al. (1966) and has become a consensus.\nRecently, a short video has been created to present Lorenz\'s perspective on predictability limit.\nA recent study refers to the two-week predictability limit, initially calculated in the 1960s with the Mintz-Arakawa model\'s five-day doubling time, as the "Predictability Limit Hypothesis." Inspired by Moore\'s Law, this term acknowledges the collaborative contributions of Lorenz, Mintz, and Arakawa under Charney\'s leadership. The hypothesis supports the investigation into extended-range predictions using both partial differential equation (PDE)-based physics methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.\n==== Revised perspectives on chaotic and non-chaotic systems ====\nBy revealing coexisting chaotic and non-chaotic attractors within Lorenz models, Shen and his colleagues proposed a revised view that "weather possesses chaos and order", in contrast to the conventional view of "weather is chaotic". As a result, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC) does not always appear. Namely, SDIC appears when two orbits (i.e., solutions) become the chaotic attractor; it does not appear when two orbits move toward the same point attractor. The above animation for double pendulum motion provides an analogy. For large angles of swing the motion of the pendulum is often chaotic. By comparison, for small angles of swing, motions are non-chaotic.\nMultistability is defined when a system (e.g., the double pendulum system) contains more than one bounded attractor that depends only on initial conditions. The multistability was illustrated using kayaking in Figure on the right side (i.e., Figure 1 of ) where the appearance of strong currents and a stagnant area suggests instability and local stability, respectively. As a result, when two kayaks move along strong currents, their paths display SDIC. On the other hand, when two kayaks move into a stagnant area, they become trapped, showing no typical SDIC (although a chaotic transient may occur). Such features of SDIC or no SDIC suggest two types of solutions and illustrate the nature of multistability.\nBy taking into consideration time-varying multistability that is associated with the modulation of large-scale processes (e.g., seasonal forcing) and aggregated feedback of small-scale processes (e.g., convection), the above revised view is refined as follows:\n"The atmosphere possesses chaos and order; it includes, as examples, emerging organized systems (such as tornadoes) and time varying forcing from recurrent seasons."\n=== In quantum mechanics ===']

Context: ['The Ehrenfest classification implicitly allows for continuous phase transformations, where the bonding character of a material changes, but there is no discontinuity in any free energy derivative. An example of this occurs at the supercritical liquid–gas boundaries.\nThe first example of a phase transition which did not fit into the Ehrenfest classification was the exact solution of the Ising model, discovered in 1944 by Lars Onsager. The exact specific heat differed from the earlier mean-field approximations, which had predicted that it has a simple discontinuity at critical temperature. Instead, the exact specific heat had a logarithmic divergence at the critical temperature. In the following decades, the Ehrenfest classification was replaced by a simplified classification scheme that is able to incorporate such transitions.\n=== Modern classifications ===\nIn the modern classification scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes:\nFirst-order phase transitions are those that involve a latent heat. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a fixed (and typically large) amount of energy per volume. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a "mixed-phase regime" in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not.\nFamiliar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into vapor, but forms a turbulent mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Yoseph Imry and Michael Wortis showed that quenched disorder can broaden a first-order transition. That is, the transformation is completed over a finite range of temperatures, but phenomena like supercooling and superheating survive and hysteresis is observed on thermal cycling.\nSecond-order phase transitions are also called "continuous phase transitions". They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an infinite correlation length, and a power law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the ferromagnetic transition, superconducting transition (for a Type-I superconductor the phase transition is second-order at zero external field and for a Type-II superconductor the phase transition is second-order for both normal-state–mixed-state and mixed-state–superconducting-state transitions) and the superfluid transition. In contrast to viscosity, thermal expansion and heat capacity of amorphous materials show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature which enables accurate detection using differential scanning calorimetry measurements.  Lev Landau gave a phenomenological theory of second-order phase transitions.\nApart from isolated, simple phase transitions, there exist transition lines as well as multicritical points, when varying external parameters like the magnetic field or composition.\nSeveral transitions are known as infinite-order phase transitions.\nThey are continuous but break no symmetries. The most famous example is the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition in the two-dimensional XY model. Many quantum phase transitions, e.g., in two-dimensional electron gases, belong to this class.\nThe liquid–glass transition is observed in many polymers and other liquids that can be supercooled far below the melting point of the crystalline phase. This is atypical in several respects. It is not a transition between thermodynamic ground states: it is widely believed that the true ground state is always crystalline. Glass is a quenched disorder state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon: on cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium. Some theoretical methods predict an underlying phase transition in the hypothetical limit of infinitely long relaxation times. No direct experimental evidence supports the existence of these transitions.\n== Characteristic properties ==\n=== Phase coexistence ===\nA disorder-broadened  first-order transition occurs over a finite range of temperatures where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a critical cooling rate, and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions. This slowing down happens below a glass-formation temperature Tg, which may depend on the applied pressure. If the first-order freezing transition occurs over a range of temperatures, and Tg falls within this range, then there is an interesting possibility that the transition is arrested when it is partial and incomplete. Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature. First reported in the case of a ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transition, such persistent phase coexistence has now been reported across a variety of first-order magnetic transitions. These include colossal-magnetoresistance manganite materials, magnetocaloric materials, magnetic shape memory materials, and other materials.\nThe interesting feature of these observations of Tg falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic fields can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between Tg and Tc in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.\n=== Critical points ===\nIn any system containing liquid and gaseous phases, there exists a special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the critical point, at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition. Near the critical point, the fluid is sufficiently hot and compressed that the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases is almost non-existent. This is associated with the phenomenon of critical opalescence, a milky appearance of the liquid due to density fluctuations at all possible wavelengths (including those of visible light).\n=== Symmetry ===\nPhase transitions often involve a symmetry breaking process. For instance, the cooling of a fluid into a crystalline solid breaks continuous translation symmetry: each point in the fluid has the same properties, but each point in a crystal does not have the same properties (unless the points are chosen from the lattice points of the crystal lattice). Typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries than the low-temperature phase due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the exception of certain accidental symmetries (e.g. the formation of heavy virtual particles, which only occurs at low temperatures).\n=== Order parameters ===\nAn order parameter is a measure of the degree of order across the boundaries in a phase transition system; it normally ranges between zero in one phase (usually above the critical point) and nonzero in the other. At the critical point, the order parameter susceptibility will usually diverge.\nAn example of an order parameter is the net magnetization in a ferromagnetic system undergoing a phase transition. For liquid/gas transitions, the order parameter is the difference of the densities.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, order parameters arise from symmetry breaking. When this happens, one needs to introduce one or more extra variables to describe the state of the system. For example, in the ferromagnetic phase, one must provide the net magnetization, whose direction was spontaneously chosen when the system cooled below the Curie point. However, note that order parameters can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions.\nSome phase transitions, such as superconducting and ferromagnetic, can have order parameters for more than one degree of freedom. In such phases, the order parameter may take the form of a complex number, a vector, or even a tensor, the magnitude of which goes to zero at the phase transition.\nThere also exist dual descriptions of phase transitions in terms of disorder parameters. These indicate the presence of line-like excitations such as vortex- or defect lines.\n=== Relevance in cosmology ===\nSymmetry-breaking phase transitions play an important role in cosmology. As the universe expanded and cooled, the vacuum underwent a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, the electroweak transition broke the SU(2)×U(1) symmetry of the electroweak field into the U(1) symmetry of the present-day electromagnetic field. This transition is important to explain the asymmetry between the amount of matter and antimatter in the present-day universe, according to  electroweak baryogenesis theory.\nProgressive phase transitions in an expanding universe are implicated in the development of order in the universe, as is illustrated by the work of Eric Chaisson and David Layzer.\nSee also relational order theories and order and disorder.\n=== Critical exponents and universality classes ===', 'The Ehrenfest classification implicitly allows for continuous phase transformations, where the bonding character of a material changes, but there is no discontinuity in any free energy derivative.

Context: ['In astronomy, the main sequence is a classification of stars which appear on plots of stellar color versus brightness as a continuous and distinctive band. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars, and positions of stars on and off the band are believed to indicate their physical properties, as well as their progress through several types of star life-cycles. These are the most numerous true stars in the universe and include the Sun. Color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams after Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.\nAfter condensation and ignition of a star, it generates thermal energy in its dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. During this stage of the star\'s lifetime, it is located on the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass but also based on its chemical composition and age. The cores of main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation on temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity, or both.\nThe main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant process that a star uses to generate energy. The Sun, along with main sequence stars below about 1.5 times the mass\nof the Sun (1.5 M☉), primarily fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the proton–proton chain. Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen as intermediaries in the CNO cycle that produces helium from hydrogen atoms. Main-sequence stars with more than two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, which acts to stir up the newly created helium and maintain the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur. Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely radiative with convective zones near the surface. With decreasing stellar mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily increases. The main-sequence stars below 0.4 M☉ undergo convection throughout their mass. When core convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded by an outer layer of hydrogen.\nThe more massive a star is, the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, the star evolves away from the main sequence on the HR diagram, into a supergiant, red giant, or directly to a white dwarf.\n== History ==\nIn the early part of the 20th century, information about the types and distances of stars became more readily available. The spectra of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward Charles Pickering at Harvard College Observatory developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard Classification Scheme, published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.\nIn Potsdam in 1906, the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups. These stars are either much brighter than the Sun or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them "giant" and "dwarf" stars. The following year he began studying star clusters; large groupings of stars that are co-located at approximately the same distance. For these stars, he published the first plots of color versus luminosity. These plots showed a prominent and continuous sequence of stars, which he named the Main Sequence.\nAt Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was following a similar course of research. He was studying the relationship between the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose, he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\nOf the red stars observed by Hertzsprung, the dwarf stars also followed the spectra-luminosity relationship discovered by Russell. However, giant stars are much brighter than dwarfs and so do not follow the same relationship. Russell proposed that "giant stars must have low density or great surface brightness, and the reverse is true of dwarf stars". The same curve also showed that there were very few faint white stars.\nIn 1933, Bengt Strömgren introduced the term Hertzsprung–Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram. This name reflected the parallel development of this technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.\nAs evolutionary models of stars were developed during the 1930s, it was shown that, for stars with the same composition, the star\'s mass determines its luminosity and radius. Conversely, when a star\'s chemical composition and its position on the main sequence are known, the star\'s mass and radius can be deduced. This became known as the Vogt–Russell theorem; named after Heinrich Vogt and Henry Norris Russell. It was subsequently discovered that this relationship breaks down somewhat for stars of the non-uniform composition.\nA refined scheme for stellar classification was published in 1943 by William Wilson Morgan and Philip Childs Keenan. The MK classification assigned each star a spectral type—based on the Harvard classification—and a luminosity class.  The Harvard classification had been developed by assigning a different letter to each star based on the strength of the hydrogen spectral line before the relationship between spectra and temperature was known.  When ordered by temperature and when duplicate classes were removed,  the spectral types of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. (A popular mnemonic for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is "Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me".) The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.\nIn April 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant "ordinary" (i.e., main sequence) star, named Icarus (formally, MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1), at 9 billion light-years away from Earth.\n== Formation and evolution ==\nWhen a protostar is formed from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Once sufficiently dense, stars begin converting hydrogen into helium and giving off energy through an exothermic nuclear fusion process.\nWhen nuclear fusion of hydrogen becomes the dominant energy production process and the excess energy gained from gravitational contraction has been lost, the star lies along a curve on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (or HR diagram) called the standard main sequence. Astronomers will sometimes refer to this stage as "zero-age main sequence", or ZAMS. The ZAMS curve can be calculated using computer models of stellar properties at the point when stars begin hydrogen fusion. From this point, the brightness and surface temperature of stars typically increase with age.\nA star remains near its initial position on the main sequence until a significant amount of hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and to the right of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star\'s lifetime.\n== Classification ==\nMain sequence stars are divided into the following types:\nO-type main-sequence star\nB-type main-sequence star\nA-type main-sequence star\nF-type main-sequence star\nG-type main-sequence star\nK-type main-sequence star\nM-type main-sequence star\nM-type (and, to a lesser extent, K-type) main-sequence stars are usually referred to as red dwarfs.\n== Properties ==\nThe majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main-sequence curve. This line is pronounced because both the spectral type and the luminosity depends only on a star\'s mass, at least to zeroth-order approximation, as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most of their "active" lives doing.\nThe temperature of a star determines its spectral type via its effect on the physical properties of plasma in its photosphere. A star\'s energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the color index, B − V, which measures the star\'s magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. This difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star\'s temperature.\n== Dwarf terminology ==', 'In astronomy, the main sequence is a classification of stars which appear on plots of stellar color versus brightness as a continuous and distinctive band.

This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\nOf the red stars observed by Hertzsprung, the dwarf stars also followed the spectra-luminosity relationship discovered by Russell. However, giant stars are much brighter than dwarfs and so do not follow the same relationship. Russell proposed that "giant stars must have low density or great surface brightness, and the reverse is true of dwarf stars". The same curve also showed that there were very few faint white stars.\nIn 1933, Bengt Strömgren introduced the term Hertzsprung–Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram. This name reflected the parallel development of this technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.\nAs evolutionary models of stars were developed during the 1930s, it was shown that, for stars with the same composition, the star\'s mass determines its luminosity and radius. Conversely, when a star\'s chemical composition and its position on the main sequence are known, the star\'s mass and radius can be deduced. This became known as the Vogt–Russell theorem; named after Heinrich Vogt and Henry Norris Russell. It was subsequently discovered that this relationship breaks down somewhat for stars of the non-uniform composition.\nA refined scheme for stellar classification was published in 1943 by William Wilson Morgan and Philip Childs Keenan. The MK classification assigned each star a spectral type—based on the Harvard classification—and a luminosity class.  The Harvard classification had been developed by assigning a different letter to each star based on the strength of the hydrogen spectral line before the relationship between spectra and temperature was known.  When ordered by temperature and when duplicate classes were removed,  the spectral types of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. (A popular mnemonic for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is "Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me".) The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.\nIn April 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant "ordinary" (i.e., main sequence) star, named Icarus (formally, MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1), at 9 billion light-years away from Earth.\n== Formation and evolution ==\nWhen a protostar is formed from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Once sufficiently dense, stars begin converting hydrogen into helium and giving off energy through an exothermic nuclear fusion process.\nWhen nuclear fusion of hydrogen becomes the dominant energy production process and the excess energy gained from gravitational contraction has been lost, the star lies along a curve on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (or HR diagram) called the standard main sequence. Astronomers will sometimes refer to this stage as "zero-age main sequence", or ZAMS. The ZAMS curve can be calculated using computer models of stellar properties at the point when stars begin hydrogen fusion. From this point, the brightness and surface temperature of stars typically increase with age.\nA star remains near its initial position on the main sequence until a significant amount of hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and to the right of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star\'s lifetime.\n== Classification ==\nMain sequence stars are divided into the following types:\nO-type main-sequence star\nB-type main-sequence star\nA-type main-sequence star\nF-type main-sequence star\nG-type main-sequence star\nK-type main-sequence star\nM-type main-sequence star\nM-type (and, to a lesser extent, K-type) main-sequence stars are usually referred to as red dwarfs.\n== Properties ==\nThe majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main-sequence curve. This line is pronounced because both the spectral type and the luminosity depends only on a star\'s mass, at least to zeroth-order approximation, as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most of their "active" lives doing.\nThe temperature of a star determines its spectral type via its effect on the physical properties of plasma in its photosphere. A star\'s energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the color index, B − V, which measures the star\'s magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. This difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star\'s temperature.\n== Dwarf terminology ==']

Question: What is the reason behind the designation of Class L dwarfs, and what is their color and composition?

Choices:
Choice A) Class L dwarfs are hotter than M stars and are designated L because L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. They are bright blue in color and are brightest in ultraviolet. Their atmosphere is hot enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.
Choice B) Class L dwarfs are cooler than M stars and are designated L because L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. They are dark red in color and are brightest in infrared. Their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.
Choice C) Class L dwarfs are hotter than M stars and are designated L because L is the next letter alphabetically after M. They are dark red in color and are brightest in infrared. Their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra.

Context: ['Maxwell\'s demon is a thought experiment that appears to disprove the second law of thermodynamics. It was proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. In his first letter, Maxwell referred to the entity as a "finite being" or a "being who can play a game of skill with the molecules". Lord Kelvin would later call it a "demon".\nIn the thought experiment, a demon controls a door between two chambers containing gas. As individual gas molecules (or atoms) approach the door, the demon quickly opens and closes the door to allow only fast-moving molecules to pass through in one direction, and only slow-moving molecules to pass through in the other. Because the kinetic temperature of a gas depends on the velocities of its constituent molecules, the demon\'s actions cause one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down. This would decrease the total entropy of the system, seemingly without applying any work, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics.\nThe concept of Maxwell\'s demon has provoked substantial debate in the philosophy of science and theoretical physics, which continues to the present day. It stimulated work on the relationship between thermodynamics and information theory. Most scientists argue that, on theoretical grounds, no device can violate the second law in this way. Other researchers have implemented forms of Maxwell\'s demon in experiments, though they all differ from the thought experiment to some extent and none has been shown to violate the second law.\n== Origin and history of the idea ==\nThe thought experiment first appeared in a letter Maxwell wrote to Peter Guthrie Tait on 11 December 1867. It appeared again in a letter to John William Strutt in 1871, before it was presented to the public in Maxwell\'s 1872 book on thermodynamics titled Theory of Heat.\nIn his letters and books, Maxwell described the agent opening the door between the chambers as a "finite being". Being a deeply religious man, he never used the word "demon". Instead, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) was the first to use it for Maxwell\'s concept, in the journal Nature in 1874, and implied that he intended the Greek mythology interpretation of a daemon, a supernatural being working in the background, rather than a malevolent being.\n== Original thought experiment ==\nThe second law of thermodynamics ensures (through statistical probability) that two bodies of different temperature, when brought into contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe, will evolve to a thermodynamic equilibrium in which both bodies have approximately the same temperature. The second law is also expressed as the assertion that in an isolated system, entropy never decreases.\nMaxwell conceived a thought experiment as a way of furthering the understanding of the second law. His description of the experiment is as follows:\n... if we conceive of a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course, such a being, whose attributes are as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is impossible to us. For we have seen that molecules in a vessel full of air at uniform temperature are moving with velocities by no means uniform, though the mean velocity of any great number of them, arbitrarily selected, is almost exactly uniform. Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, A and B, by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see the individual molecules, opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from A to B, and only the slower molecules to pass from B to A. He will thus, without expenditure of work, raise the temperature of B and lower that of A, in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.In other words, Maxwell imagines one container divided into two parts, A and B. Both parts are filled with the same gas at equal temperatures and placed next to each other. Observing the molecules on both sides, an imaginary demon guards a trapdoor between the two parts. When a faster-than-average molecule from A flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from A to B. Likewise, when a slower-than-average molecule from B flies towards the trapdoor, the demon will let it pass from B to A. The average speed of the molecules in B will have increased while in A they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in A and increases in B, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.  A heat engine operating between the thermal reservoirs A and B could extract useful work from this temperature difference.\nThe demon must allow molecules to pass in both directions in order to produce only a temperature difference; one-way passage only of faster-than-average molecules from A to B will cause higher temperature and pressure to develop on the B side.\n== Criticism and development ==\nSeveral physicists have presented calculations that show that the second law of thermodynamics will not actually be violated, if a more complete analysis is made of the whole system including the demon. The essence of the physical argument is to show, by calculation, that any demon must "generate" more entropy segregating the molecules than it could ever eliminate by the method described. That is, it would take more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the opening between A and B than the amount of energy gained by the difference of temperature caused by doing so.\nOne of the most famous responses to this question was suggested in 1929 by Leó Szilárd, and later by Léon Brillouin.  Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell\'s demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Since the demon and the gas are interacting, we must consider the total entropy of the gas and the demon combined. The expenditure of energy by the demon will cause an increase in the entropy of the demon, which will be larger than the lowering of the entropy of the gas.\nIn 1960, Rolf Landauer raised an exception to this argument.  He realized that some measuring processes need not increase thermodynamic entropy as long as they were thermodynamically reversible. He suggested these "reversible" measurements could be used to sort the molecules, violating the Second Law. However, due to the connection between entropy in thermodynamics and information theory, this also meant that the recorded measurement must not be erased. In other words, to determine whether to let a molecule through, the demon must acquire information about the state of the molecule and either discard it or store it. Discarding it leads to immediate increase in entropy, but the demon cannot store it indefinitely. In 1982, Charles Bennett showed that, however well prepared, eventually the demon will run out of information storage space and must begin to erase the information it has previously gathered. Erasing information is a thermodynamically irreversible process that increases the entropy of a system. Although Bennett had reached the same conclusion as Szilard\'s 1929 paper, that a Maxwellian demon could not violate the second law because entropy would be created, he had reached it for different reasons.  Regarding Landauer\'s principle, the minimum energy dissipated by deleting information was experimentally measured by Eric Lutz et al. in 2012. Furthermore, Lutz et al. confirmed that in order to approach the Landauer\'s limit, the system must asymptotically approach zero processing speed.\nRecently, Landauer\'s principle has also been invoked to resolve an apparently unrelated paradox of statistical physics, Loschmidt’s paradox.\nJohn Earman and John D. Norton have argued that Szilárd and Landauer\'s explanations of Maxwell\'s demon begin by assuming that the second law of thermodynamics cannot be violated by the demon, and derive further properties of the demon from this assumption, including the necessity of consuming energy when erasing information, etc. It would therefore be circular to invoke these derived properties to defend the second law from the demonic argument. Bennett later acknowledged the validity of Earman and Norton\'s argument, while maintaining that Landauer\'s principle explains the mechanism by which real systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.\n== Recent progress ==', 'Maxwell\'s demon is a thought experiment that appears to disprove the second law of thermodynamics.

Given the following question, context, and choices, carefully analyze each choice to determine which one is correct. Break down the problem step by step:

Context: ['The pulmonary circulation is a division of the circulatory system in all vertebrates. The circuit begins with deoxygenated blood returned from the body to the right atrium of the heart where it is pumped out from the right ventricle to the lungs. In the lungs the blood is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium to complete the circuit.\nThe other division of the circulatory system is the systemic circulation that begins with receiving the oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circulation into the left atrium. From the atrium the oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the rest of the body, returning as deoxygenated blood back to the pulmonary circulation.\nThe blood vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins.\nA separate circulatory circuit known as the bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.\n== Structure ==\nDe-oxygenated blood leaves the heart, goes to the lungs, and then enters back into the heart. De-oxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. From the right atrium, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve (or right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle. Blood is then pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery.\n=== Lungs ===\nThe pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration.

In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 CE) based on the comprehensive completeness and correctness of his model, despite its relative recency. Other sources credit one or more of Greek philosopher Hippocrates (460 – 370 BCE), Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis (1213 – 1288 CE), Syrian physician Qusta ibn Luqa or Spanish physician Michael Servetus (c. 1509 – 1553 CE). Several figures such as Hippocrates and al-Nafis receive credit for accurately predicting or developing specific elements of the modern model of pulmonary circulation: Hippocrates for being the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system separable from systemic circulation as a whole and al-Nafis for making great strides over the understanding of those before him and towards a rigorous model. There is a great deal of subjectivity involved in deciding at which point a complex system is "discovered", as it is typically elucidated in piecemeal form so that the very first description, most complete or accurate description, and the most significant forward leaps in understanding are all considered acts of discovery of varying significance.\nEarly descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found throughout several ancient cultures. The earliest known description of the role of air in circulation was produced in Egypt in 3500 BCE. At the time, the Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the body to each other and transported air – as well as urine, blood, and the soul – between them. The Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 – 1906 CE) who purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse that transported the above substances throughout the body. A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. Although they had knowledge of the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances through the vessels to air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart\'s exertion of pressure.The Egyptians knew that air played an important role in circulation but did not yet have a conception of the role of the lungs.\nThe next addition to the historical understanding of pulmonary circulation arrived with the Ancient Greeks. Physician Alcmaeon (520 – 450 BCE) proposed that the brain, not the heart, was the connection point for all of the vessels in the body. He believed that the function of these vessels was to bring the "spirit" ("pneuma") and air to the brain. Empedocles (492 – 432 BCE), a philosopher, proposed a series of pipes, impermeable to blood but continuous with blood vessels, that carried the pneuma throughout the body. He proposed that this spirit was internalized by pulmonary respiration.\nHippocrates was the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system, separable from systemic circulation, in his Corpus Hippocraticum, which is often regarded as the foundational text of modern medicine. Hippocrates developed the view that the liver and spleen produced blood, and that this traveled to the heart to be cooled by the lungs that surrounded it. He described the heart as having two ventricles connected by an interventricular septum, and depicted the heart as the nexus point of all of the vessels of the body. He proposed that some vessels carried only blood and that others carried only air. He hypothesized that these air-carrying vessels were divisible into the pulmonary veins, which carried in air to the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery, which carried in air to the right ventricle and blood to the lungs. He also proposed the existence of two atria of the heart functioning to capture air. He was one of the first to begin to accurately describe the anatomy of the heart and to describe the involvement of the lungs in circulation. His descriptions built substantially on previous and contemporaneous efforts but, by modern standards, his conceptions of pulmonary circulation and of the functions of the parts of the heart were still largely inaccurate.\nGreek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs. Greek physician Erasistratus (315 – 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was drawn into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries, which contained only air. In this system, veins distributed blood throughout the body, and thus blood did not circulate, but rather was consumed by the organs.', 'The pulmonary circulation is a division of the circulatory system in all vertebrates. The circuit begins with deoxygenated blood returned from the body to the right atrium of the heart where it is pumped out from the right ventricle to the lungs. In the lungs the blood is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium to complete the circuit.\nThe other division of the circulatory system is the systemic circulation that begins with receiving the oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circulation into the left atrium. From the atrium the oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the rest of the body, returning as deoxygenated blood back to the pulmonary circulation.\nThe blood vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins.\nA separate circulatory circuit known as the bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.\n== Structure ==\nDe-oxygenated blood leaves the heart, goes to the lungs, and then enters back into the heart. De-oxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. From the right atrium, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve (or right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle. Blood is then pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery.\n=== Lungs ===\nThe pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration.

Context: ['Heat treating (or heat treatment) is a group of industrial, thermal and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass. Heat treatment involves the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case hardening, precipitation strengthening, tempering, carburizing, normalizing and quenching. Although the term heat treatment applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for the specific purpose of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing processes such as hot forming or welding.\n== Physical processes ==\nMetallic materials consist of a microstructure of small crystals called "grains" or crystallites. The nature of the grains (i.e. grain size and composition) is one of the most effective factors that can determine the overall mechanical behavior of the metal. Heat treatment provides an efficient way to manipulate the properties of the metal by controlling the rate of diffusion and the rate of cooling within the microstructure. Heat treating is often used to alter the mechanical properties of a metallic alloy, manipulating properties such as the hardness, strength, toughness, ductility, and elasticity.\nThere are two mechanisms that may change an alloy\'s properties during heat treatment: the formation of martensite causes the crystals to deform intrinsically, and the diffusion mechanism causes changes in the homogeneity of the alloy.\nThe crystal structure consists of atoms that are grouped in a very specific arrangement, called a lattice. In most elements, this order will rearrange itself, depending on conditions like temperature and pressure. This rearrangement called allotropy or polymorphism, may occur several times, at many different temperatures for a particular metal. In alloys, this rearrangement may cause an element that will not normally dissolve into the base metal to suddenly become soluble, while a reversal of the allotropy will make the elements either partially or completely insoluble.\nWhen in the soluble state, the process of diffusion causes the atoms of the dissolved element to spread out, attempting to form a homogenous distribution within the crystals of the base metal. If the alloy is cooled to an insoluble state, the atoms of the dissolved constituents (solutes) may migrate out of the solution. This type of diffusion, called precipitation, leads to nucleation, where the migrating atoms group together at the grain-boundaries.  This forms a microstructure generally consisting of two or more distinct phases. For instance, steel that has been heated above the austenizing temperature (red to orange-hot, or around 1,500 °F (820 °C) to 1,600 °F (870 °C) depending on carbon content), and then cooled slowly, forms a laminated structure composed of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite, becoming soft pearlite.   After heating the steel to the austenite phase and then quenching it in water, the microstructure will be in the martensitic phase. This is due to the fact that the steel will change from the austenite phase to the martensite phase after quenching. Some pearlite or ferrite may be present if the quench did not rapidly cool off all the steel.\nUnlike iron-based alloys, most heat-treatable alloys do not experience a ferrite transformation. In these alloys, the nucleation at the grain-boundaries often reinforces the structure of the crystal matrix. These metals harden by precipitation. Typically a slow process, depending on temperature, this is often referred to as "age hardening".\nMany metals and non-metals exhibit a martensite transformation when cooled quickly (with external media like oil, polymer, water, etc.). When a metal is cooled very quickly, the insoluble atoms may not be able to migrate out of the solution in time. This is called a "diffusionless transformation." When the crystal matrix changes to its low-temperature arrangement, the atoms of the solute become trapped within the lattice. The trapped atoms prevent the crystal matrix from completely changing into its low-temperature allotrope, creating shearing stresses within the lattice. When some alloys are cooled quickly, such as steel, the martensite transformation hardens the metal, while in others, like aluminum, the alloy becomes softer.\n== Effects of composition ==\nThe specific composition of an alloy system will usually have a great effect on the results of heat treating. If the percentage of each constituent is just right, the alloy will form a single, continuous microstructure upon cooling. Such a mixture is said to be eutectoid. However, If the percentage of the solutes varies from the eutectoid mixture, two or more different microstructures will usually form simultaneously. A hypo eutectoid solution contains less of the solute than the eutectoid mix, while a hypereutectoid solution contains more.\n=== Eutectoid alloys ===\nA eutectoid (eutectic-like) alloy is similar in behavior to a eutectic alloy. A eutectic alloy is characterized by having a single melting point. This melting point is lower than that of any of the constituents, and no change in the mixture will lower the melting point any further. When a molten eutectic alloy is cooled, all of the constituents will crystallize into their respective phases at the same temperature.\nA eutectoid alloy is similar, but the phase change occurs, not from a liquid, but from a solid solution. Upon cooling a eutectoid alloy from the solution temperature, the constituents will separate into different crystal phases, forming a single microstructure. A eutectoid steel, for example, contains 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling slowly, the solution of iron and carbon (a single phase called austenite) will separate into platelets of the phases ferrite and cementite. This forms a layered microstructure called pearlite.\nSince pearlite is harder than iron, the degree of softness achievable is typically limited to that produced by the pearlite. Similarly, the hardenability is limited by the continuous martensitic microstructure formed when cooled very fast.\n=== Hypoeutectoid alloys ===\nA hypoeutectic alloy has two separate melting points. Both are above the eutectic melting point for the system but are below the melting points of any constituent forming the system. Between these two melting points, the alloy will exist as part solid and part liquid. The constituent with the higher melting point will solidify first. When completely solidified, a hypoeutectic alloy will often be in a solid solution.\nSimilarly, a hypoeutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures, called "arrests". Between these two temperatures, the alloy will exist partly as the solution and partly as a separate crystallizing phase, called the "pro eutectoid phase". These two temperatures are called the upper (A3) and lower (A1) transformation temperatures. As the solution cools from the upper transformation temperature toward an insoluble state, the excess base metal will often be forced to "crystallize-out", becoming the pro eutectoid. This will occur until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.\nFor example, a hypoeutectoid steel contains less than 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling a hypoeutectoid steel from the austenite transformation temperature, small islands of proeutectoid-ferrite will form. These will continue to grow and the carbon will recede until the eutectoid concentration in the rest of the steel is reached. This eutectoid mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of pearlite. Since ferrite is softer than pearlite, the two microstructures combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the hardenability of the alloy is lowered.\n=== Hypereutectoid alloys ===\nA hypereutectic alloy also has different melting points. However, between these points, it is the constituent with the higher melting point that will be solid. Similarly, a hypereutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures. When cooling a hypereutectoid alloy from the upper transformation temperature, it will usually be the excess solutes that crystallize-out first, forming the pro-eutectoid. This continues until the concentration in the remaining alloy becomes eutectoid, which then crystallizes into a separate microstructure.\nA hypereutectoid steel contains more than 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling hypereutectoid steel, the cementite will begin to crystallize first. When the remaining steel becomes eutectoid in composition, it will crystallize into pearlite. Since cementite is much harder than pearlite, the alloy has greater hardenability at a cost in ductility.\n== Effects of time and temperature ==\nProper heat treating requires precise control over temperature, time held at a certain temperature and cooling rate.', 'Heat treating (or heat treatment) is a group of industrial, thermal and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material.

Context: ['Free neutron decay\n\nWhen embedded in an atomic nucleus, neutrons are (usually) stable particles. Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 877.75+0.50−0.44 s or 879.6±0.8 s (about 14 min and 37.75 s or 39.6 s, respectively). Therefore, the half-life for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of ln(2) ≈ 0.693) is 611±1 s (about 10 min, 11 s).\nThe free neutron decays primarily by beta decay, with small probability of other channels.\nThe beta decay of the neutron can be described at different levels of detail, starting with the simplest:\nn0 → p+ +  e− + νe\nQuantitative measurements of the free neutron decay time vary slightly between different measurement techniques for reasons which have not been determined.\n== Energy budget ==\nFor the free neutron, the decay energy for this process (based on the rest masses of the neutron, proton and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. That is the difference between the rest mass of the neutron and the sum of the rest masses of the products. That difference has to be carried away as kinetic energy. The maximal energy of the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782±0.013 MeV. The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the neutrino (which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy); furthermore, neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods.\nA small fraction (about 1 in 1,000) of free neutrons decay with the same products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray:\nn0 → p+ + e− + νe + γ\nThis gamma ray may be thought of as a sort of "internal bremsstrahlung" that arises as the emitted beta particle (electron) interacts with the charge of the proton in an electromagnetic way.

Question: What is the relation between the three moment theorem and the bending moments at three successive supports of a continuous beam?

Choices:
Choice A) The three moment theorem expresses the relation between the deflection of two points on a beam relative to the point of intersection between tangent at those two points and the vertical through the first point.
Choice B) The three moment theorem is used to calculate the maximum allowable bending moment of a beam, which is determined by the weight distribution of each segment of the beam.
Choice C) The three moment theorem describes the relationship between bending moments at three successive supports of a continuous beam, subject to a loading on two adjacent spans with or without settlement of the supports.
Choice D) The three moment theorem is used to calculate the weight distribution of each segment of a beam, which is required to apply Mohr's theorem.
Choice E) The three moment theorem is used to derive the change in slope of a deflection curve between two points of a beam, which is equal to the area of the M/EI diagram between those two points.

Given the following question, context, and choices, carefully analyze each choice to determine which one is correct. Break down the problem step by step:

Context: ['Cardiac skeleton\n\nIn cardiology, the cardiac skeleton, also known as the fibrous skeleton of the heart, is a high-density homogeneous structure of connective tissue that forms and anchors the valves of the heart, and influences the forces exerted by and through them. The cardiac skeleton separates and partitions the atria (the smaller, upper two chambers) from the ventricles (the larger, lower two chambers). The heart\'s cardiac skeleton comprises four dense connective tissue rings that encircle the mitral and tricuspid atrioventricular (AV) canals and extend to the origins of the pulmonary trunk and aorta. This provides crucial support and structure to the heart while also serving to electrically isolate the atria from the ventricles.\nThe unique matrix of connective tissue within the cardiac skeleton isolates electrical influence within these defined chambers. In normal anatomy, there is only one conduit for electrical conduction from the upper chambers to the lower chambers, known as the atrioventricular node. The physiologic cardiac skeleton forms a firewall governing autonomic/electrical influence until bordering the bundle of His which further governs autonomic flow to the bundle branches of the ventricles. Understood as such, the cardiac skeleton efficiently centers and robustly funnels electrical energy from the atria to the ventricles.\n== Structure ==\nThe structure of the components of the heart has become an area of increasing interest. The cardiac skeleton binds several bands of dense connective tissue, as collagen, that encircle the bases of the pulmonary trunk, aorta, and all four heart valves. While not a traditionally or "true" or rigid skeleton, it does provide structure and support for the heart, as well as isolate the atria from the ventricles. This is why atrial fibrillation almost never degrades to ventricular fibrillation. In youth, this collagen structure is free of calcium adhesions and is quite flexible. With aging, calcium and other mineral accumulation occur within this skeleton. Distensibility of the ventricles is tied to variable accumulation of minerals which also contributes to the delay of the depolarization wave in geriatric patients that can take place from the AV node and the bundle of His.\n=== Fibrous rings ===\nThe right and left fibrous rings of heart (annuli fibrosi cordis) surround the atrioventricular and arterial orifices.  The right fibrous ring is known as the annulus fibrosus dexter cordis, and the left is known as the annulus fibrosus sinister cordis. The right fibrous trigone is continuous with the central fibrous body. This is the strongest part of the fibrous cardiac skeleton.\nThe upper chambers (atria) and lower (ventricles) are electrically divided by the properties of collagen proteins within the rings. The valve rings, central body, and skeleton of the heart consisting of collagen are impermeable to electrical propagation. The only channel allowed (barring accessory/rare preexcitation channels) through this collagen barrier is represented by a sinus that opens up to the atrioventricular node and exits to the bundle of His. The muscle origins/insertions of many of the cardiomyocytes are anchored to opposite sides of the valve rings.\nThe atrioventricular rings serve for the attachment of the muscular fibers of the atria and ventricles, and for the attachment of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves.\nThe left atrioventricular ring is closely connected, by its right margin, with the aortic arterial ring; between these and the right atrioventricular ring is a triangular mass of fibrous tissue, the fibrous trigone, which represents the os cordis seen in the heart of some of the larger animals, such as the ox.\nLastly, there is the tendinous band, already referred to, the posterior surface of the conus arteriosus.\nThe fibrous rings surrounding the arterial orifices serve for the attachment of the great vessels and semilunar valves, they are known as The aortic annulus.\nEach ring receives, by its ventricular margin, the attachment of some of the muscular fibers of the ventricles; its opposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, to which the middle coat of the artery is firmly fixed.\nThe attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring is strengthened by the external coat and serous membrane externally, and by the endocardium internally.\nFrom the margins of the semicircular notches, the fibrous structure of the ring is continued into the segments of the valves.\nThe middle coat of the artery in this situation is thin, and the vessel is dilated to form the sinuses of the aorta and pulmonary artery.\n=== Os cordis ===\nIn some animals, the fibrous trigone can undergo increasing mineralization with age, leading to the formation of a significant os cordis (heart bone), or two (os cordis sinistrum and os cordis dextrum, the latter being the larger one). The os cordis is thought to serve mechanical functions.\nIn humans, two paired trigones (left and right) are seen in this essential view of anatomy. As a surgical purchase point, the Trigones risk much in AV propagation.\nIt has been known since Classical times in deer and oxen and was thought to have medicinal properties and mystical properties. It is occasionally observed in goats, but also in other animals such as otters. It was recently also discovered in chimpanzees, the only great ape so far to known to have os cordis.\nAgainst the opinion of his time, Galen wrote that the os cordis was also found in elephants. The claim endured up to the nineteenth century and was still treated as fact in Gray\'s Anatomy, although it is not the case.\n== Function ==\nElectrical signals from the sinoatrial node and the autonomic nervous system must find their way from the upper chambers to the lower ones to ensure that the ventricles can drive the flow of blood. The heart functions as a pump delivering an intermittent volume of blood, incrementally delivered to the lungs, body, and brain.\nThe cardiac skeleton ensures that the electrical and autonomic energy generated above is ushered below and cannot return. The cardiac skeleton does this by establishing an electrically impermeable boundary to autonomic electrical influence within the heart. Simply put, the dense connective tissue within the cardiac skeleton does not conduct electricity and its deposition within the myocardial matrix is not accidental.\nThe anchored and electrically inert collagen framework of the four valves allows normal anatomy to house the atrioventricular node (AV node) in its center. The AV node is the only electrical conduit from the atria to the ventricles through the cardiac skeleton, which is why atrial fibrillation can never degrade into ventricular fibrillation.\nThroughout life, the cardiac collagen skeleton is remodeled. Where collagen is diminished by age, calcium is often deposited, thus allowing readily imaged mathematical markers which are especially valuable in measuring systolic volumetrics. The inert characteristics of the collagen structure that blocks electrical influence also make it difficult to attain an accurate signal for imaging without allowing for an applied ratio of collagen to calcium.\n== History ==\nBoundaries within the heart were first described and greatly magnified by Drs. Charles S. Peskin and David M. McQueen at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\n== See also ==\nChordae tendineae\nFibrous ring of intervertebral disk\nCoronary arteries\nCoronary sinus\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 536 of the 20th edition of Gray\'s Anatomy (1918)\n== External links ==\nDescription at cwc.net\nHistology (see slide #96)', 'Cardiac skeleton\n\nIn cardiology, the cardiac skeleton, also known as the fibrous skeleton of the heart, is a high-density homogeneous structure of connective tissue that forms and anchors the valves of the heart, and influences the forces exerted by and through them.

Distensibility of the ventricles is tied to variable accumulation of minerals which also contributes to the delay of the depolarization wave in geriatric patients that can take place from the AV node and the bundle of His.\n=== Fibrous rings ===\nThe right and left fibrous rings of heart (annuli fibrosi cordis) surround the atrioventricular and arterial orifices.  The right fibrous ring is known as the annulus fibrosus dexter cordis, and the left is known as the annulus fibrosus sinister cordis. The right fibrous trigone is continuous with the central fibrous body. This is the strongest part of the fibrous cardiac skeleton.\nThe upper chambers (atria) and lower (ventricles) are electrically divided by the properties of collagen proteins within the rings. The valve rings, central body, and skeleton of the heart consisting of collagen are impermeable to electrical propagation. The only channel allowed (barring accessory/rare preexcitation channels) through this collagen barrier is represented by a sinus that opens up to the atrioventricular node and exits to the bundle of His. The muscle origins/insertions of many of the cardiomyocytes are anchored to opposite sides of the valve rings.\nThe atrioventricular rings serve for the attachment of the muscular fibers of the atria and ventricles, and for the attachment of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves.\nThe left atrioventricular ring is closely connected, by its right margin, with the aortic arterial ring; between these and the right atrioventricular ring is a triangular mass of fibrous tissue, the fibrous trigone, which represents the os cordis seen in the heart of some of the larger animals, such as the ox.\nLastly, there is the tendinous band, already referred to, the posterior surface of the conus arteriosus.\nThe fibrous rings surrounding the arterial orifices serve for the attachment of the great vessels and semilunar valves, they are known as The aortic annulus.\nEach ring receives, by its ventricular margin, the attachment of some of the muscular fibers of the ventricles; its opposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, to which the middle coat of the artery is firmly fixed.\nThe attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring is strengthened by the external coat and serous membrane externally, and by the endocardium internally.\nFrom the margins of the semicircular notches, the fibrous structure of the ring is continued into the segments of the valves.\nThe middle coat of the artery in this situation is thin, and the vessel is dilated to form the sinuses of the aorta and pulmonary artery.\n=== Os cordis ===\nIn some animals, the fibrous trigone can undergo increasing mineralization with age, leading to the formation of a significant os cordis (heart bone), or two (os cordis sinistrum and os cordis dextrum, the latter being the larger one). The os cordis is thought to serve mechanical functions.\nIn humans, two paired trigones (left and right) are seen in this essential view of anatomy. As a surgical purchase point, the Trigones risk much in AV propagation.\nIt has been known since Classical times in deer and oxen and was thought to have medicinal properties and mystical properties. It is occasionally observed in goats, but also in other animals such as otters. It was recently also discovered in chimpanzees, the only great ape so far to known to have os cordis.\nAgainst the opinion of his time, Galen wrote that the os cordis was also found in elephants. The claim endured up to the nineteenth century and was still treated as fact in Gray\'s Anatomy, although it is not the case.\n== Function ==\nElectrical signals from the sinoatrial node and the autonomic nervous system must find their way from the upper chambers to the lower ones to ensure that the ventricles can drive the flow of blood. The heart functions as a pump delivering an intermittent volume of blood, incrementally delivered to the lungs, body, and brain.\nThe cardiac skeleton ensures that the electrical and autonomic energy generated above is ushered below and cannot return. The cardiac skeleton does this by establishing an electrically impermeable boundary to autonomic electrical influence within the heart. Simply put, the dense connective tissue within the cardiac skeleton does not conduct electricity and its deposition within the myocardial matrix is not accidental.\nThe anchored and electrically inert collagen framework of the four valves allows normal anatomy to house the atrioventricular node (AV node) in its center. The AV node is the only electrical conduit from the atria to the ventricles through the cardiac skeleton, which is why atrial fibrillation can never degrade into ventricular fibrillation.\nThroughout life, the cardiac collagen skeleton is remodeled. Where collagen is diminished by age, calcium is often deposited, thus allowing readily imaged mathematical markers which are especially valuable in measuring systolic volumetrics. The inert characteristics of the collagen structure that blocks electrical influence also make it difficult to attain an accurate signal for imaging without allowing for an applied ratio of collagen to calcium.\n== History ==\nBoundaries within the heart were first described and greatly magnified by Drs. Charles S. Peskin and David M. McQueen at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\n== See also ==\nChordae tendineae\nFibrous ring of intervertebral disk\nCoronary arteries\nCoronary sinus\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 536 of the 20th edition of Gray\'s Anatomy (1918)\n== External links ==\nDescription at cwc.net\nHistology (see slide #96)']
