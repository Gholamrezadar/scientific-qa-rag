## What keywords do you need me to search for you to answer the question?

```text
you are a scientist who is trying to answer a question about a scientific topic. i can provide you with a bunch of text from wikipedia articles, but you need to give me keywords to search for to find the answer.

here is the question:
what is the relationship between chemical potential and quarks/antiquarks?

what keywords do you need me to search for you to answer the question?
i can only search for up to 3 keywords, so be picky and choose the most relevant keywords.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT EXPLAIN OR CHAT, ONLY RESPOND WITH THE KEYWORDS(COMMA SEPERATED)
comma separated list of keywords:

TODO: check effectiveness of the prompt by asking different models to answer the question.






Let’s analyze each choice:

*   **Choice A) The main sequence is a type of galaxy that contains a large number of stars.** – This is incorrect. The main sequence is a *region* of space where stars are forming and existing, not a galaxy. Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, and dust.

*   **Choice B) The main sequence is a type of black hole that is formed from the collapse of a massive star.** – This is incorrect. The main sequence is formed by the gravitational collapse of massive stars, not black holes.

*   **Choice C) The main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars.** – This is the most accurate description of the main sequence. It accurately describes the characteristics of this region of the stellar life cycle.

*   **Choice D) The main sequence is a group of planets that orbit around a star in a solar system.** – This is incorrect. The main sequence is a region of space where stars are forming and existing, not a group of planets.

*   **Choice E) The main sequence is a type of nebula that is formed from the explosion of a supernova.** – This is incorrect. Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust, not a type of star.

Based on the analysis, **Choice C** is the correct answer.

Answer: C
