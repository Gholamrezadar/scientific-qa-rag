What is the Maxwell's Demon thought experiment?,"A thought experiment in which a demon guards a microscopic trapdoor in a wall separating two parts of a container filled with different gases at equal temperatures. The demon selectively allows molecules to pass from one side to the other, causing an increase in temperature in one part and a decrease in temperature in the other, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.","A thought experiment in which a demon guards a macroscopic trapdoor in a wall separating two parts of a container filled with different gases at different temperatures. The demon selectively allows molecules to pass from one side to the other, causing a decrease in temperature in one part and an increase in temperature in the other, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.","A thought experiment in which a demon guards a microscopic trapdoor in a wall separating two parts of a container filled with the same gas at equal temperatures. The demon selectively allows faster-than-average molecules to pass from one side to the other, causing a decrease in temperature in one part and an increase in temperature in the other, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.","A thought experiment in which a demon guards a macroscopic trapdoor in a wall separating two parts of a container filled with the same gas at equal temperatures.
