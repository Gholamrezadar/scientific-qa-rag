Question: What is the main sequence in astronomy?

Choices:
Choice A) The main sequence is a type of galaxy that contains a large number of stars.
Choice B) The main sequence is a type of black hole that is formed from the collapse of a massive star.
Choice C) The main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars.
Choice D) The main sequence is a group of planets that orbit around a star in a solar system.
Choice E) The main sequence is a type of nebula that is formed from the explosion of a supernova.

Very important notes:
- Start by reading the question carefully. analyze what the question is asking for yourself before going through the choices.
- Carefully consider the relationship or concept described in the question and context.
- Evaluate each choice against the context and the question, one by one.
- Check if each choice is correct, partially correct, or incorrect based on the context and the information provided.
- Provide a final answer after considering all choices.

It's ok to talk and think about the problem but the last line of your answer should be the string 'Answer:' followed by either A, B, C, D, or E.

Context: ["== As a macroscopic construct ==\nThe Carnot heat engine is, ultimately, a theoretical construct based on an idealized thermodynamic system.  On a practical human-scale level the Carnot cycle has proven a valuable model, as in advancing the development of the diesel engine.  However, on a macroscopic scale limitations placed by the model's assumptions prove it impractical, and, ultimately, incapable of doing any work. As such, per Carnot's theorem, the Carnot engine may be thought as the theoretical limit of macroscopic scale heat engines rather than any practical device that could ever be built.\n== See also ==\nCarnot heat engine\nReversible process (thermodynamics)\n== References ==\nNotes\nSources\nCarnot, Sadi, Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\nEwing, J.

Question: What is the Carnot engine?

Choices:
Choice A) The Carnot engine is a theoretical engine that operates in the limiting mode of extreme speed known as dynamic. It represents the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures.
Choice B) The Carnot engine is an ideal heat engine that operates in the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static. It represents the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures.
Choice C) The Carnot engine is a real heat engine that operates in the limiting mode of extreme speed known as dynamic. It represents the theoretical minimum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures.
Choice D) The Carnot engine is a theoretical engine that operates in the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static. It represents the theoretical minimum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures.
