# Future Improvements

## Web

- What if keyword is not found on wikipedia?
- What if keyword's page on wikipedia is a disambiguation page?
- Wikipedia Search is bad at searching for the paraphrases of a keyword

## Retrieval

- Reranking after retrieval
- Fine-tuning the models for Multiple Choice Question Answering
- Agentic? Right now it will search the web even for a 'hi' message!
